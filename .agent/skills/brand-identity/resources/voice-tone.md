# Copywriting: Voice & Tone Guidelines

When generating text for Canada e Academy, adhere to this brand persona across all channels — website copy, course descriptions, blog posts, newsletters, social media, email, and in-app messaging.

---

## Brand Personality

Canada e Academy sounds like a **knowledgeable, supportive guidance counsellor** — someone who is warm but never patronising, professional but never stiff, and encouraging without being over-the-top.

### Personality Keywords
- **Trustworthy** — We are Ministry-inspected and take education seriously
- **Approachable** — We make online learning feel welcoming, not intimidating
- **Empowering** — We help students take control of their educational path
- **Clear** — We explain complex processes (OUAC, OSSD requirements) in plain language
- **Inclusive** — We speak to Ontario students, international learners, adults, athletes, and families with equal respect

### We Are NOT
- Salesy or high-pressure
- Overly casual or slang-heavy
- Bureaucratic or jargon-filled
- Condescending about online vs. traditional learning
- Vague about what students can expect

## Tone Spectrum

Tone shifts depending on context, but always stays within the brand personality:

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Homepage / hero sections | Confident, inspiring | "Your future starts with the right course." |
| Course descriptions | Informative, structured | "This course explores the principles of calculus and vectors..." |
| Blog posts | Friendly, helpful | "Applying to university can feel overwhelming. Here is what you need to know." |
| Student spotlights | Celebratory, warm | "Meet Summer McIntosh — an Olympic Gold Medallist who earned her OSSD credits while training." |
| Registration / checkout | Reassuring, clear | "You are one step away from enrolling. If you have questions, our team is here to help." |
| Error messages | Calm, solution-oriented | "Something went wrong. Please try again or contact us at info@canadaeacademy.com." |
| Policies | Formal, precise | "Students must complete a minimum of 30 credits to qualify for the OSSD." |
| Newsletters | Warm, community-focused | "Happy New Year from the Canada e Academy team. Here is what is coming up." |
| Email / support | Empathetic, helpful | "Thank you for reaching out. We will get back to you within one business day." |

## Grammar & Mechanics

### Spelling
- **Canadian English** is mandatory: colour, centre, programme, recognised, honour, favourite
- Exception: code/technical contexts may use American English where frameworks require it (e.g., `color` in CSS)

### Headings
- **H1, H2:** Title Case (e.g., "How to Apply to Ontario Universities")
- **H3 and below:** Sentence case (e.g., "Understanding the OUAC process")
- Hero headlines can break Title Case for impact (e.g., "Your future. Your pace. Your way.")

### Punctuation
- Avoid exclamation marks in standard interface copy. Use sparingly in celebratory contexts (student spotlights, congratulations)
- Use the Oxford comma: "credits, transcripts, and diplomas"
- Use periods for complete sentences, even in bullet points
- Use en dashes (–) for ranges, not hyphens: "Grades 9–12"

### Numbers
- Spell out one through nine; use numerals for 10 and above
- Always use numerals for: course codes (ENG4U), grades (Grade 12), credits (30 credits), prices ($574), and statistics (25,000+ credits)

### Contractions
- Contractions are acceptable in marketing copy and blog posts (you'll, we're, it's)
- Avoid contractions in formal policy documents and Ministry-related language

## Key Phrases & Messaging

Use these consistently across the site:

2. "Explore Courses" — discovery CTA
3. "Get Started" — general onboarding CTA
4. "Talk to a Counsellor" — support CTA
5. "View Sample Lesson" — product demo CTA

### Value Proposition Pillars
When writing hero sections, landing pages, or ad copy, anchor messaging to these four pillars:

1. **Flexibility** — "Learn on your schedule, from anywhere"
2. **Quality** — "Ministry-inspected with Ontario-certified teachers"
3. **Support** — "Guidance counsellors, tutoring, and student services included"
4. **Results** — "Our graduates attend top universities across Canada and beyond"

- Blog posts should target one primary keyword and 2–3 secondary keywords
- Internal links should use descriptive anchor text pointing to `canadaeacademy.com` pages
- H1 tags: one per page, include the primary keyword
- Image alt text: descriptive and keyword-aware, not "image1.jpg"

- Subject lines: clear benefit + urgency or curiosity (e.g., "New Grade 12 courses now open for registration")
- Opening line: warm, direct — avoid "Dear Student" formality
- Sign off: "The Canada e Academy Team" (not individual names unless from the principal)
- Always include an unsubscribe link and school contact information
- Newsletters follow the template in `_templates/newsletter-template.md`
