Online school has become a much [more popular option in recent years](https://madeinca.ca/distance-e-learning-statistics-canada/). However, making the transition from in-person learning to digital learning can make some families a bit nervous, especially when dealing with not just online elementary school, but online high school.

Here at [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), we understand the concerns of these families, and want to answer their questions and put their minds at ease. Here are answers to questions we hear from families every day.

## 1. Is online school a good idea for high school?

The decision to complete high school online is a personal one. While some people may prefer in-person classes over online classes, there are many benefits of online high school, generally providing students and their families with more freedom and control over their own education.

## 2. How do online classes work for high school?

Many people may be thinking about online high school learning, but are hesitant due to a particular question: How does online high school work? The answer depends on the school.

At some schools, students log on to virtual meetings at particular times, to have live lessons with teachers and other students. Here at [OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/register-online/), however, is a more self-paced online high school. Classes follow an [asynchronous model](https://www.coursera.org/ca/articles/what-is-asynchronous-learning), where lessons are recorded, and students can view them at any time, even rewinding and repeating them if they wish. Students can then email teachers at any time, to ask individualized questions and receive individualized feedback.

Either way, assignments must be completed and submitted online. All forms of online school also come with the advantage that lessons can be viewed from anywhere with an internet connection.

## 3. What is the biggest problem with online school?

Online school allows students more freedom and control over their own education, but this freedom also comes with more responsibility.

Without a teacher in the room to remind them to stay on task, or the strict schedules of synchronous schooling models, students may find that they need to be more self-motivated. Time management for online students, and avoiding procrastination in online classes, is essential.

While this self-motivation is an important skill for later life, and practicing it in high school can be very useful, some students may find it to be one of the challenges of online high school.

## 4. How many hours a week is online school?

This can differ depending on the school and the student. Most online high schools are intended to require approximately the same amount of hours as an in-person school. However, since schools like OVS allow for a more flexible schedule high school students may choose to complete courses more quickly if they grasp the content easily, or more slowly if they find the material more challenging.

## 5. Is switching to online school worth it?

It all depends on your situation. Some students, such as those whose schedules or circumstances prevent them from attending in-person schools regularly, or whose local schools do not provide all the courses they want to take, or who want to complete high school faster, find online school to be a near-essential option. Other students may simply find that it more closely suits their learning style, or that they could benefit from completing courses at their own pace. However, it’s ultimately a personal decision for each student.

Of course, each student’s situation is different, and you may have further questions.
