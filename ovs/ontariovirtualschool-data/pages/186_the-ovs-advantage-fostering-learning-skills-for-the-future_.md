# The OVS Advantage: Fostering Learning Skills for the Future - Ontario Virtual School

**Source:** https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/the-ovs-advantage-fostering-learning-skills-for-the-future
**Description:** In today’s fast-changing world, it’s not just what students know that matters, but how they think, learn, and problem-solve. In fact, the researchers behind the Institute for Habits of Mind have identified 16 habits that form the basis for the behaviours, skills, and dispositions foundational to effective thinkers. This means that students who practice and hone these skills are more likely to be prepared for unfamiliar situations and more resilient in the real world.

In today’s fast-changing world, it’s not just what students know that matters, but how they think, learn, and problem-solve. In fact, the researchers behind the [Institute for Habits of Mind](https://www.habitsofmindinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Student-HOM-Explanation.pdf) have identified [16 habits](https://www.habitsofmindinstitute.org/about-us/) that form the basis for the behaviours, skills, and dispositions foundational to effective thinkers. This means that students who practice and hone these skills are more likely to be prepared for unfamiliar situations and more resilient in the real world.

## Learning Skills in Ontario Virtual School Courses

As an [accredited high school in Ontario](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/private-school-contact-information), Ontario Virtual School also supports students in developing and demonstrating such learning skills. While the practice of learning skills in a virtual high school may initially seem challenging, the way in which OVS students develop and demonstrate their learning skills is becoming increasingly relevant and valuable in a digital world. As highlighted by the [OECD Future of Education and Skills 2030](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/about/projects/edu/education-2040/1-1-learning-compass/OECD_Learning_Compass_2030_Concept_Note_Series.pdf), students need skills for a future that is not yet imagined, and therefore require skills to help “thrive in and even shape whatever the future holds” (p. 5). Ontario Virtual School’s online courses – whether it’s [ENG4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4u/) or [MHF4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mhf4u/) – support students in developing their learning skills and allow them to demonstrate such skills in a unique way.

## Strengthening and Applying Learning Skills in a Virtual World

# **Responsibility**

A responsible student is someone who *takes responsibility for and manages their own behaviour.* In a virtual setting, students may demonstrate this skill by using technology and online resources appropriately. For example, ensuring that students give credit to original sources when researching or creating is a valuable skill that demonstrates responsibility.

# **Organization**

An organized student is someone who *identifies, gathers, evaluates, and uses information, technology, and resources to complete tasks*. In a virtual setting, students become accustomed to [navigating the OVS platform and course learning modules](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/faq/) in order to learn independently, find answers to questions, and submit tasks for evaluations. Students develop and practice the skill of compiling digital files, ensuring that the digital work is organized and properly submitting them using the OVS Dropbox.

# **Independent Work**

A student who works independently is someone who *monitors, assesses, and revises plans to complete tasks and meet goals with minimal supervision*. While [teachers and support staff](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/meet-our-staff/) are always available to answer student questions, as a self-paced online high school, the students at OVS develop strong skills in independence and learn how to leverage a flexible high school schedule.

# **Collaboration**

A collaborative student is someone who *shares information, resources, and expertise and promotes critical thinking to solve problems and make decisions.* Whether it’s preparing for an asynchronous presentation, doing research for a text or contributing to an online discussion forum, OVS students have the opportunity to practice and develop their skills in a safe and equitable virtual learning environment.

# **Initiative**

A student who takes initiative is someone who *looks for and acts on new ideas and opportunities for learning*. While the advantage of asynchronous learning at OVS is having access to everything you need to learn 24/7, students have the option to email teachers for clarification about a topic or to ask a question about an assignment. In doing so, students demonstrate curiosity in learning and wanting to take ownership of their education.

# **Self-Regulation**

A student who demonstrates self-regulation is someone who *sets their own individual goals and monitors progress towards achieving them*. This is one of the most valuable skills that OVS students develop and demonstrate throughout a course. The ability to work effectively and efficiently without direct supervision is a transferable skill in many settings.
