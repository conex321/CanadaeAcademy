## Fundamental Concepts Covered in Grade 12 English Online Course

The compulsory online course is organized into broad four strands:

* Oral communication
* Reading and literature studies
* Writing
* Media studies

Students learn best when they are encouraged to consciously monitor their thinking as they learn, and such reflection is expected in each strand.

The knowledge and skills gained in the language curriculum enable students to understand, respond to, create, and appreciate a full range of literary, informational, and media texts.

Learning areas are closely interrelated. The knowledge and skills described in the four strands are interdependent and complementary. Teachers plan activities that blend expectations from the four strands to provide promote meaningful, holisitic learning. Students will begin to recognise how their developing skills in the four strands reinforce each other.

## Online Teaching and Learning Strategies

Teachers bring enthusiasm and varied teaching and assessment approaches to the classroom. Every student is offered sound learning opportunities and the chance to have individual interests and issues addressed. The ENG4U English curriculum is built on the premise that **all students can be successful language learners**.

Learning activities offered enable students to relate and apply these concepts to the social, environmental, and economical conditions and concerns of the world in which they live. Relating knowledge and skills to wider contexts motivates students to learn in a meaningful way and become life-long learners.

We recognize one of the keys to mastering language skills is high-quality instruction. Our teachers respect students’ strengths and address their learning needs, using assessment information.. Teachers work to differentiate instruction for individual students and small groups as needed. The course is intended to clarify the reason for learning and help students activate preexisting knowledge.

During the course, students are encouraged to talk through their thinking and learning processes. They receive many opportunities to practice and apply their developing knowledge and skills. Effective teaching encourages higher-level thinking skills andto look beyond the literal meaning of texts, to think about issues of fairness, equity, social justice, and citizenship in a global society.

## Assessment & Evaluation

As summarized in [Growing Success 2010](http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/success.html), the primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning. Information gathered through assessment helps teachers to determine students’ strengths and weaknesses and adapt curriculum and instructional approaches accordingly.

As part of assessment, teachers provide students with descriptive feedback to help guide their learning Evaluation refers to the process of measuring the quality of work against an established criteria, and assigning a value representative of work quality. All curriculum expectations must be accounted for in instruction, but evaluation focuses on students’ achievement of the overall expectations.

A students’ achievement is evaluated in relation to specific expectations. Teachers use their professional judgement to determine which specific expectations should be used to evaluate achievement of overall expectations, and which ones will be covered in instruction and assessment but not used as an evaluation benchmark. To ensure assessment and evaluation are valid and fair teachers use assessment and evaluation strategies that:

* Address both what students learn and how well they learn
* Are based on the achievement level descriptions given in the achievement chart
* Are varied in nature, administered over time, and designed to provide opportunities for students to demonstrate the full range of their learning
* Are appropriate for the learning activities used, the purposes of instruction, and the needs and experiences of the students
* Are fair to all students
* Accommodate students with special education needs, consistent with the strategies outlined in their Individual Education Plan
* Accommodate the needs of students who are learning the language of instruction
* Ensure that each student is given clear directions for improvement
* Promote students’ ability to assess their own learning and to set specific goals
* Include student work samples as evidence their achievement
* Are communicated clearly to students and parents at the beginning of the school year and at other appropriate points throughout the school year.

The achievement chart outlines four categories of knowledge and skills:

1. Knowledge and understanding
2. Critical thinking
3. Communication
4. Application

Teachers assess and/or evaluate work in a balanced manner with respect to the four categories. A final grade is recorded, and a credit is granted and recorded for this course if the student’s grade is 50% or higher. The final grade for this course will be determined as follows:

**Seventy percent of the grade** is based on evaluations conducted throughout the course. This portion of the grade reflects the student’s most consistent level of achievement throughout the course, although special consideration should be given to more recent evidence of achievement.

**Thirty percent of the grade** is based on a final evaluation and administered towards the end of the course.

## Special Accommodations for Students with an IEP

Every single student is capable of success. Some students are able, with certain [accommodations](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/iep-accommodations/), to participate in the regular course curriculum and demonstrate independent learning.

I just finished my grade 12 English course and it was awesome!! Very easy to understand and to get around the course. My teacher Mr. Ford was awesome and was very easy to reach out to and always put me on the right path to always achieve the best mark possible.

Enrolling at OVS as a full time grade 12 student was the best decision I could have made. I was skeptical before as I thought I would not be able to communicate with my teachers very well compared to face to face communication, however, I was proved wrong. All my teachers made me feel comfortable enough to ask any questions that I had and responded to me quicker than I thought they would. They were all very thorough and kind when explaining the concepts to me and were very patient with me. However, my ENG4U teacher, Ms. McDonnell, has truly been one of the greatest teachers I have met throughout my high school years. Her support has been incredible and she has helped me gain the confidence I needed in my writing more than anyone. Ms McDonnell has always instantly replied to my emails and has been patient with me even when she had to explain one concept multiple times. She is a teacher I will remember even after I have completed my post-secondary education. OVS has really helped me grow as a person and has given me the opportunity to get brilliant education. I appreciate all my teachers and all the effort they put in providing good quality education for their students.

Ontario Virtual School was extremely helpful and had always replied quickly to my questions. Sir Lewis Scott, my tutor, has been exceptionally good to me and guided me very well throughtout the course. I had taken ENG4U in order to be eligible for my desired universities but along with that, I was able to gain great confidence over my language skills. Mr Scott was always ready to help and I am thankful for that.
I'd highly recommend Ontario Virtual School and Sir Lewis Scott to anybody who needs to add this course for admissions to a Canadian university.

I decided to take this course through a friend's recommendation, who told me that it was a great experience. Despite that, I was still a bit unsure but decided to take a leap of faith and purchase the course. It was an amazing decision because this was the best way for me to achieve a high mark and thorough understanding of the course content. There were no hidden fees whatsoever, and once you paid the initial amount for the course, that was it. I'm a senior in high school and took MHF4U and it was a great experience. The lessons were easy to follow along and understand, and the workload was a breeze as well, considering how exceptional the teaching was. The Unit Tests were also very simple to follow along, especially with the phenomenal lessons and organization. I was also pleasantly surprised with the response time through emails, as it was very fast, with teachers and administrators. I also received my report cards very quickly, after submitting my request through the site. Plus, when I received marked work back, it was easy to follow along and helpful to see what I needed to work on. Overall, this was an absolutely awesome experience and i'd definitely recommend that anyone who is on the fence about taking an online course should for sure do it with OVS!

Ontario Virtual school was an amazing experience. They helped me earn a credit and achieve the grade I wanted. The teacher I had for my course (HFA4U) was extremely helpful and made it easy for me to understand the concepts taught in the course as the slideshows were easy to follow. The website was amazing and super easy to navigate through. It even allowed my parents to sign into my account as a "guardian" so they can look at my work and my sure I am on track. The lessons were super easy to follow as the slides shows were interactive and clear making it easy for the viewer to comprehend. There were no hidden fees at any given point during the corosue the expense was the flat fee (purchasing the course.) My work I submitted was always returned very quick and I was provided with feedback to always help me improve for the next assignment. When requesting my midterm and final report card the admin made it super easy as they processed it very quickly and sent it over to my school. Quick and simple!
Overall Ontario Virtual School was an amazing experience as the admin and staff are all professionals and made it easy for me to gain my credit while at the same time teaching me a lot as I left the course (HFA4U) with lots of great knowledge.
