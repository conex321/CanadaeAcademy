**Description:** While originally starting out as a high school program, OVS has been making steady progress on branching out into Middle School programming, so that more students have access to an online education.  Whether you continue into high school courses with OVS or you decide to attend another high school, these five subjects in both Grade 7 and 8 are the core building blocks for creating a foundation of knowledge that students will use to be successful in high school.

## What is Middle School?

Depending on what province in Canada you live in, each school system has a different set of rules. Meaning what is considered middle school in one province might not be the same in another. Even what it’s called can be different, while provinces like Manitoba and New Brunswick call it “Middle School” other provinces such as Alberta or Nova Scotia might call it “Junior High”. The general idea, no matter what you call it, is that it covers the middle years of grade school, usually spanning somewhere between grade 6 to grade 9, depending on the province.

In Ontario, [Grade 7 and 8](https://www.ourkids.net/school/canadian-province-grade-levels#:~:text=In%20most%20provinces%2C%20middle%20school,from%20Grade%209%20to%2012.) are considered the “middle school” grades. However, depending on which region of Ontario you live in, there are a few different options when it comes to attending grade school.

Option 1: You’ll attend an elementary school from kindergarten to grade 8, then attend a high school from grade 9 to 12.

Option 2: You’ll attend an elementary school from kindergarten to grade 6, then attend a middle school for grades 7 and 8, before moving on to high school for grades 9-12.

Option 3: You’ll attend an elementary school from kindergarten to grade 6, then a high school from grade 7 to 12. This is primarily done in smaller, more rural communities, where class size and space availability dictate which school you’ll be attending.

Option 4: You’ll attend the same school for all grade levels, but there are different spaces for the younger grades’ vs the older ones.

No matter which type of school you attend, grade 7 to 8 falls directly in the middle of the grade system. For our purposes, we’ll define middle school by Ontario standards, meaning grade 7 and 8.
