There are many benefits to taking courses with OVS, whether you’re a local or international student. Our flexible online platform allows students to study at their own pace and get the courses they need quickly. However, for international students we offer many benefits over traditional study models.

## 1. Attend an Ontario School without having to relocate

Many international students desire a Canadian high school education. Whether they wish to attend post-secondary in Canada or study abroad, a Canadian high school diploma can be an asset.

However, many students either can’t or don’t want to move to Canada in order to attend high school. Moving to a new country can be financially difficult and emotionally taxing if you aren’t able to move with your family. As well, for international students planning to study in Canada, an education visa is often required. This can be a lengthy and complicated process that can often leave students frustrated.

At OVS, [International students](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/international-students/) can study from anywhere in the world, and they aren’t required to have a study visa either. Whether you want to take a few courses or get the entire Ontario Secondary School Diploma, you can customize your learning.

Our lessons are pre-recorded lectures, which means you can watch them whenever you’d like without having to worry about the time difference. There are no set due dates for tests or assignments, so you can work at your own pace.

Ontario Virtual School makes it convenient for international students to get a Canadian education from the comfort of their own home.

## 2. Get prerequisites for applications to Canadian Colleges and Universities

Perhaps you’re an international student who has already completed their high school education and are now beginning to apply to universities and colleges. You’ve taken a look at application requirements for a Canadian school and they list specific courses that you need to take in order to apply.

You can take individual courses at Ontario Virtual School to help you meet these prerequisite requirements. If you’re interested in Computer Science or Engineering, we offer advanced Math ([MHF4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mhf4u/), [MCV4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mcv4u/)), Science ([SPH4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sph4u/)) and Computer Science ([ICS4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/ics4u/)) courses that are often required for these programs.

Using a combination of your international diploma and courses taken at OVS, you can apply to many Canadian colleges and universities.

## 3. Earn an OSSD using your international credits

You might be partway through your high school education or maybe you graduated, but are now interested in earning the Ontario Secondary School Diploma. However, you might be concerned that you’ll have to restart your education from the very beginning and relearn subjects you already know. That isn’t the case with OVS.

We’ll take a look at your international transcripts and give you Credit Equivalencies. What this does is give you credits for your international courses that you can then use to put towards your [Ontario Secondary School Diploma.](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ossd-requirements/) That way, you can get credit for the work you already did, and then take the remaining necessary courses you’d need in order to graduate with an OSSD.
