**Description:** Did you know - that according to UNESCO - there are more than 7000 languages spoken around the world today? With this increased diversity in the linguistic landscape, the need for cross-cultural understanding is more important than ever. While learning an additional language is not a new concept, there is now an increased benefit to learning a new language, as it provides the skills needed to build peace, tolerance and respect for differences both within and outside of the classroom.

Did you know – that according to [UNESCO](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000392477) – there are more than 7000 languages spoken around the world today? With this increased diversity in the linguistic landscape, the need for cross-cultural understanding is more important than ever. While learning an additional language is not a new concept, there is now an increased benefit to learning a new language, as it provides the skills needed to [build peace, tolerance and respect for differences](https://www.unesco.org/en/languages-education?hub=84624) both within and outside of the classroom.

## Bilingualism in Canada

In 1969, Canada adopted the [*Official Languages Act*](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/as-sa/98-200-X/2021013/98-200-x2021013-eng.cfm), making English and French Canada’s official languages. In support of this, the [Education Act](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90e02) also made French language instruction mandatory in Ontario schools, with students obliged to study the language for a period of 6 years from grades 4 through 9, with the option to continue studying French up to Grade 12 and beyond.

## French Language Learning at Ontario Virtual School

As one of the [best online high schools in Ontario](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/recommendations-students-parents/) who recognize the value of language learning, OVS offers a variety of online French courses for students to take as part of their Ontario high school diploma requirements.

Although OVS offers Gr. 9-12 Core French courses, a popular course for students to take is [Gr. 9 Core French (FSF1D)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/fsf1d/). Since OVS is an [accredited online high school](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/private-school-contact-information) in Ontario, students who complete this course will be able to count this towards their Ontario high school diploma requirements. With a focus on communication through high-interest topics, this course is a great option for students who wish to have a more flexible high school schedule or who wish to work at their own pace in a virtual environment.

Ontario Virtual School also offers a wide selection of [French Immersion courses](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/french-immersion/). Whether it’s [BBB4MF](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/bbb4mf/) (Gr. 12 International Business in French) or [HFA4UF](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/HFA4UF), (Gr. 12 Nutrition and Health in French), students are taught by [highly qualified teachers](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/meet-our-staff/) who have a passion for French language and culture. In these courses, students are able to further develop their French language skills through reading, writing, listening and speaking while also benefiting from course content.

## Cognitive Benefits of Language Learning

While students in Ontario don’t have to take French beyond Gr. 9, it’s important to note that studying a language has far more value than just fulfilling a compulsory subject. As explained in the journal article [*The Cognitive Benefits of Being Bilingual*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3583091/), the bilingual brain can have better attention and task-switching capacities than the monolingual brain, thus having an overall positive effect on cognitive abilities. What is more, bilingualism has been associated with improved linguistic awareness as well as with better [memory, visual-spatial skills, and even creativity](https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&lr=&id=hHFoJguRE4oC&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&ots=NZnv59fUgB&sig=3u-YRTZlFk-nEGf2bLfxiv97Ses&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false). Overall, the bilingual experience helps a person to better process information in the environment, which ultimately contributes to a clearer signal for learning. This is why studying an additional language with OVS, whether it’s French or [another international language](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/international-languages/), can have a lasting impact that extends far beyond just academics.

## Take the Next Step

If you’re a student in [Ontario](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/virtualhighschool-9-12/), an [out-of-province](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/out-of-province-students/) student, or even an [International student](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/international-students/), it’s never too late to enjoy the benefits of language learning and to develop transferable skills such as cross-cultural communication.
