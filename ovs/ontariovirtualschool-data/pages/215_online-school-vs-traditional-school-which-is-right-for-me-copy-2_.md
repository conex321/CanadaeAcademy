Each year in Canada, September 30th marks the [National Day for Truth and Reconciliation](https://www.ontario.ca/page/national-day-truth-and-reconciliation?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22934556849&gbraid=0AAAABBOyvGBYbPqcANx4HXE1XnlH-IrFj&gclid=Cj0KCQjwrJTGBhCbARIsANFBfgtjWsppPchX_Fc0UB1QkMHw5eblFPWVsm1kjBGQ0CwuRruDFE7cl_8aAgwtEALw_wcB). First held in 2021, this day recognizes and honours the Survivors of the Residential School System in Canada, as well as the families and communities who have been impacted.

## Truth and Reconciliation and the 94 Calls to Action

Prior to the inauguration of this national day, in 2015 the Truth and Reconciliation Commission published [94 calls to action](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/truth-and-reconciliation-94-calls-to-action-1.3362258) as a starting point for repairing the harm that had been caused by the Residential School System. Appealing to all levels of government and in a variety of sectors, the goal of the 94 calls to action was to also move forward with reconciliation.

## The Importance of Education

[Education](https://www.rcaanc-cirnac.gc.ca/eng/1524495412051/1557511602225) is one of the sectors in which calls to action have been proposed. In response to Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada’s Call to Action 62 and 63, the Ontario Ministry of Education has [implemented and revised several curricula](https://www.ontario.ca/page/indigenous-education-ontario) for a variety of subjects, ranging from Grade 1 to Grade 12. The goal of these changes is to increase students’ learning about First Nation, Métis, and Inuit cultures, contributions, perspectives, and histories in areas such as art, literature, law, humanities, politics and history.

## Ontario Virtual School

As an [accredited](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/private-school-contact-information) online high school in Ontario who recognizes the value of such curricula, [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/about-us/) offers 2 courses that explicitly respond to the 94 calls to action:

## NDW4M: Gr. 12 Indigenous Issues Online Course

In this [Grade 12 Indigenous Studies course](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/ndw4m/), students will examine global issues from the perspectives of Indigenous peoples, investigating topics such as identity, social justice, human rights, spirituality, resilience, and advocacy for change. Throughout this course, students develop an understanding of the concerns and aspirations of the world’s indigenous population, plan and conduct research on global issues that have an impact on indigenous peoples, and use information technology to consult materials related to the views of indigenous peoples throughout the world.

## NBE3U: Gr. 11 Understanding Contemporary First Nations, Métis, and Inuit Voices Online Course

In this [Grade 11 English course](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/nbe3u/), students explore the themes, forms, and stylistic elements of a variety of literary, informational, graphic, oral, cultural, and media text forms emerging from First Nations, Métis, and Inuit cultures in Canada, and also examines the perspectives and influence of texts that relate to those cultures. In order to fully understand contemporary text forms and their themes of identity, relationship, and self-determination, sovereignty, or self-governance, students analyse the changing use of text forms by Indigenous authors/creators from various periods and cultures in expressing ideas related to these themes.
