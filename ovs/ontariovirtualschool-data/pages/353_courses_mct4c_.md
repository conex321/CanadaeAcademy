## Fundamental Concepts Covered in Grade 12 Mathematics Online Course

The Grade 12 college preparation course Mathematics for College Technology provides excellent preparation for success in technology-related programs at the college level. It extends the understanding of functions developed in the Grade 11 university/college preparation course, Functions and Applications, using a more applied approach, and may help students who decide to pursue certain university programs to prepare for the Grade 12 university preparation course Advanced Functions. Exponential and trigonometric functions are revisited, developing algebraic skills needed to solve problems involving exponential equations and extending the skills associated with graphical representations of trigonometric functions. The Polynomial Functions strand extends to polynomial functions concepts that connect graphs and equations of quadratic functions. Finally, students apply geometric relationships to solve problems involving composite shapes and figures and investigate the properties of circles and their applications.

## Online Teaching and Learning Strategies

The mathematical processes are to be integrated into student learning in all areas of this course.
Throughout this course, students will:

* **Problem Solving** – develop, select, apply, compare, and adapt a variety of problem-solving strategies as they pose and solve problems and conduct investigations, to help deepen their mathematical understanding
* **Reasoning and Proving** – develop and apply reasoning skills (e.g., use of inductive reasoning, deductive
  reasoning, and counter-examples; construction of proofs) to make mathematical
  conjectures, assess conjectures, and justify conclusions, and plan and construct
  organized mathematical arguments;
* **Reflecting** – demonstrate that they are reflecting on and monitoring their thinking to help clarify their understanding as they complete an investigation or solve a problem (e.g., by assessing the effectiveness of strategies and processes used, by proposing alternative approaches, by judging the reasonableness of results, by verifying solutions)
* **Selecting Tools and Computational Strategies** – select and use a variety of concrete, visual, and electronic learning tools and appropriate computational strategies to investigate mathematical ideas and to solve problems
* **Connecting** – make connections among mathematical concepts and procedures, and relate mathematical ideas to situations or phenomena drawn from other contexts (e.g., other curriculum areas, daily life, current events, art and culture, sports)
* **Representing** – create a variety of representations of mathematical ideas (e.g., numeric, geometric, algebraic, graphical, pictorial representations; onscreen dynamic representations), connect and compare them, and select and apply the appropriate representations to solve problems
* **Communicating** – communicate mathematical thinking orally, visually, and in writing, using precise mathematical vocabulary and a variety of appropriate representations, and observing mathematical conventions

## Assessment & Evaluation

As summarized in [Growing Success 2010](http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/success.html), the primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning. Information gathered through assessment helps teachers to determine students’ strengths and weaknesses and adapt curriculum and instructional approaches accordingly.

As part of assessment, teachers provide students with descriptive feedback to help guide their learning Evaluation refers to the process of measuring the quality of work against an established criteria, and assigning a value representative of work quality. All curriculum expectations must be accounted for in instruction, but evaluation focuses on students’ achievement of the overall expectations.

A students’ achievement is evaluated in relation to specific expectations. Teachers use their professional judgement to determine which specific expectations should be used to evaluate achievement of overall expectations, and which ones will be covered in instruction and assessment but not used as an evaluation benchmark. To ensure assessment and evaluation are valid and fair teachers use assessment and evaluation strategies that:

* Address both what students learn and how well they learn
* Are based on the achievement level descriptions given in the achievement chart
* Are varied in nature, administered over time, and designed to provide opportunities for students to demonstrate the full range of their learning
* Are appropriate for the learning activities used, the purposes of instruction, and the needs and experiences of the students
* Are fair to all students
* Accommodate students with special education needs, consistent with the strategies outlined in their Individual Education Plan
* Accommodate the needs of students who are learning the language of instruction
* Ensure that each student is given clear directions for improvement
* Promote students’ ability to assess their own learning and to set specific goals
* Include student work samples as evidence their achievement
* Are communicated clearly to students and parents at the beginning of the school year and at other appropriate points throughout the school year.

The achievement chart outlines four categories of knowledge and skills:

1. Knowledge and understanding
2. Critical thinking
3. Communication
4. Application

Teachers assess and/or evaluate work in a balanced manner with respect to the four categories. A final grade is recorded, and a credit is granted and recorded for this course if the student’s grade is 50% or higher. The final grade for this course will be determined as follows:

**Seventy percent of the grade** is based on evaluations conducted throughout the course. This portion of the grade reflects the student’s most consistent level of achievement throughout the course, although special consideration should be given to more recent evidence of achievement.

**Thirty percent of the grade** is based on a final evaluation and administered towards the end of the course.

## Special Accommodations for Students with an IEP

Every single student is capable of success. Some students are able, with certain [accommodations](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/iep-accommodations/), to participate in the regular course curriculum and demonstrate independent learning.

[Accommodations](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/iep-accommodations/) allow access to the course without any changes to the [knowledge and skills the student is expected to demonstrate](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/assessment-evaluation/). The accommodations required to facilitate the student’s learning are identified by the teacher. Recommendations from a School Board generated [Individual Education Plan (IEP)](https://www.specialeducationguide.com/pre-k-12/individualized-education-programs-iep/the-iep-process-explained/) if available can also be consulted. Instruction based on principles of universal design and differentiated make it possible to meet the diverse needs of all learners.

**Examples of accommodations (but not limited to) include:**

* Adjusting or extending assessment deadlines
* Providing alternative assignments or summative tasks
* Use of scribes and/or other assistive technologies
* Simplifying the language of instruction

I took the MHF4U course at OVS, and the lessons were very descriptive and easy to understand. The tests were a good amount of difficulty, and you are given a more than reasonable amount of time to complete them. My teacher marked all my tests and final exam, in no more than a day, and was super helpful with any questions I had. My midterm and final marks were also uploaded to the OUAC in less than 2 days, and was a super easy process! I strongly recommend this course to anyone who's having a bit of trouble with how fast-paced their math class is at their day school, and wants to learn at their own comfortable speed.

My experience taking online courses with OVS was phenomenal! I took grade 12 Advanced Functions MHF4U and my teacher was Mr. Currie. He was extremely quick with responding to any of my questions and marking my tests, discussion posts and lab simulations. The corrections were always sent to me within 24h, even on the weekends! The course lessons were easy to follow and were delivered in an organized fashion. Doing the course at my own pace allowed me to achieve unmatched success. I would highly recommend OVS to any students interested in following the Ontario curriculum who are looking to "reach ahead" in their high school studies.

My experience with OVS was very wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and experienced learning from a wonderful teacher that helped me when I needed it most. My grade 12 math course was well structured and I ended up learning the material well.
This org is very good for students picking up credits outside of a typical school. Deadlines are mostly your own with a teacher to help you when you need it.

I recently took ENG 12 with Mr. Ford to upgrade my previous high school mark. It was very challenging but accessible. The lectures were well organized and easy to follow. Mr. Ford was very, very prompt with grading and answering emails. The expectations of the course were realistic and the practice test/exam was something I wish I'd had in high school. Not only were there practice questions but tips on what was expected from each answer. All-in-all a great experience.

I had a great time working on my MCT4C01 course as I was able to review important concepts such as trigonometry and factoring, and I learned new topics such as sinusoidal functions and arc lengths of circles which brought more interest in the course. The quality of the course is good as I was able to work at my own pace and learn the course concepts with ease. Test marking and report card distributions came at exceptional times, and the teachers, specifically Mr.Aggarwal and Ms.Reddy do their best to get back to you even at the most busiest times. Admin support is amazing as I had to postpone working on my course due to other important tasks, and I was reminded of my progress in the course and to finish it before it expires. Thank you OVS for a great learning experience and I hope you continue to do well.

Ontario Virtual school was an amazing experience. They helped me earn a credit and achieve the grade I wanted. The teacher I had for my course (HFA4U) was extremely helpful and made it easy for me to understand the concepts taught in the course as the slideshows were easy to follow. The website was amazing and super easy to navigate through. It even allowed my parents to sign into my account as a "guardian" so they can look at my work and my sure I am on track. The lessons were super easy to follow as the slides shows were interactive and clear making it easy for the viewer to comprehend. There were no hidden fees at any given point during the corosue the expense was the flat fee (purchasing the course.) My work I submitted was always returned very quick and I was provided with feedback to always help me improve for the next assignment. When requesting my midterm and final report card the admin made it super easy as they processed it very quickly and sent it over to my school. Quick and simple!
Overall Ontario Virtual School was an amazing experience as the admin and staff are all professionals and made it easy for me to gain my credit while at the same time teaching me a lot as I left the course (HFA4U) with lots of great knowledge.
