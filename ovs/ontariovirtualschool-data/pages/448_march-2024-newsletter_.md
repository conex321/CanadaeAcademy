Midterm season is here! As we move towards the middle of second semester, midterms are fast approaching. For those student’s graduating this year and applying to OUAC, the deadlines for submitting midterm marks are coming up and it’s important for students to know when they have to have their work submitted to make sure their marks are ready in time.

## OUAC Deadlines

![OUAC Collection Period 3 2024](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/OUAC-Collection-Period-3.png)

OUAC’s next collection period began on **March 18th** and will end on **April 25th**. If you would like a midterm or final mark posted during this collection, please be sure to have all required work submitted for marking by **April 17th**. Once marked, **please request a midterm/final mark through Gradebook**. We will have your mark updated by the deadline.

**Note that this is the last official submission period for midterm marks, but that midterms can be submitted outside of the deadline.** While we cannot guarantee that schools will see midterm marks submitted past the deadline, OUAC will accept submissions past this date, and many universities will periodically check OUAC for midterm marks.

She was focused on a science pathway, completing [Grade 12 Chemistry (SCH4U)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sch4u/), [Biology (SBI4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sbi4u/)), and [Physics (SPH4U)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sph4u/). She also completed [Grade 12 Advanced Functions (MHF4U)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mhf4u/), [Calculus and Vectors (MCV4U)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mcv4u/) and [Grade 12 English (ENG4U)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4u/).

## Understanding 2023-2024 Graduation Requirements

![Understanding 2023 Graduation Requirements Blog Header](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/pexels-karolina-grabowska-8106679-scaled.jpg)

There have been a lot of changes in the Ontario curriculum, from de-streaming courses for Grade 9 students, requiring online credits, and the Ontario Literacy requirement.

With all of the changes it can be hard to keep track of exactly what is required to meet Ontario to earn the OSSD.

You can check out [our blog](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/understanding-2023-graduation-requirements-for-ontario-students/), where we detail everything from required credits, to community involvement hours and more.
