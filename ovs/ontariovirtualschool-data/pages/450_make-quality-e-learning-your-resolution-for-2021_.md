With the start of a new year around the corner, it seems like everyone is busy reflecting on the year past. At OVS, we encourage you to look forward at the year to come – yes, it will still look different from what we may have hoped, but with a slower pace and more time spent at-home comes great potential to make 2021 a year to get ahead! In this week’s blog, OVS unwraps 12 reasons we believe taking a course with us is the perfect new year’s resolution!

##### 1. Universities Are Looking

Universities are starting to collect midterms and first semester/quadmester finals, which means it’s a great time for you to register to upgrade your marks or earn that last missing credit!

##### 2. Face Your Fears Online

Tackling a tough subject in a flexible online model can be a great way to improve your chances of success! Although our online courses teach the same material as traditional day schools, our method of delivery and flexible pacing allow you to achieve greater success in even the most difficult of subjects. At OVS, we encourage all our students to master concepts before moving forward in the course, and with unlimited playback on all our lessons, you can review concepts as many times as you need.

##### 3. E-Learning is The Way of the Future

With schools around the world pivoting to an online model to cope with the pandemic, the already predicted shift to e-learning has been greatly accelerated.

##### 4. Improve Your Time Management Skills

Everyone wants to get organized and improve their time management come new year’s – well, online learning will give you a reason to finally make that resolution a reality this year! With the added flexibility of self-paced online learning comes the [added responsibility](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ovs-blog/are-you-a-self-directed-learner/) of managing your time effectively. By taking a course online, you will be forced to hone your time management skills to ensure you are able to complete all the coursework within your chosen time-frame.

##### 5. It Fits Your Schedule

The flexibility of online learning means that you can customize a learning schedule that works for you! So, if your day school can’t accommodate your last-minute course needs, OVS has got your back! And best of all, you’re not held to the schedule you choose! If your start to falter, our Student Success team will send you a gentle reminder after 90 days of inactivity. This gives you enough time to jump back in and finish your course before the year is up!

##### 6. Create Balance

Are you pursuing your dream of becoming a big-time sports star? Or maybe you’re en route to be the next triple-threat on Broadway. Whatever your extra-curricular talents, it can be hard to pursue those dreams outside the confines of traditional day-school hours. Make 2021 the year you take charge of your future! Taking courses online can be a great way to balance your extracurricular interests without sacrificing a quality education that will get you into the post-secondary program of your dreams.

##### 7. Take Step #1 in the Journey to Your Dream Job

Is a career change on your resolution list for 2021? For mature students looking to switch fields, this can often mean going all the way back to high school to earn the all-important prerequisites that [post-secondary institutions will be looking for](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ovs-blog/thinking-ahead-10-ways-to-prepare-for-post-secondary-today/). With OVS, you can sign up and complete a course in as little as 4 weeks, so getting the credits you need to start your journey doesn’t need to take all year (but it can – it’s all up to you!).

##### 8. Embrace a Growth Mindset

Why not make 2021 a year of personal growth with the help of online learning? Continually learning new things and embracing challenges are cornerstones of the [growth mindset](http://blog.mindsetworks.com/what-s-my-mindset). Try to see problems as vehicles for learning, and you’ll find your outlook changing for the better, too!

##### 9. Increase Your Self-Awareness & Independence

With online learning, there won’t always be someone reassuring you that [‘you can do it’](https://www.arvinddevalia.com/blog/2007/01/16/11-tips-to-develop-a-can-do-attitude/) – so you have to learn to be confident in your own abilities, without the need for constant reassurance from third parties. You also need to be aware of your own working style and habits to be able to set a realistic working pace for yourself so you can achieve optimal success!

##### 10. Improve Your Communication Skills

E-learning teaches you to communicate your thoughts appropriately, without the aid of visual cues. Whereas shorthand and slang typically rule the virtual domain, taking courses online reinforces the need for proper email etiquette when communicating with instructors, administrators, and other students via discussion boards. Developing these kinds of professional communication skills will go a long way in our  [ever-evolving technological age](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ovs-blog/5-ways-elearning-prepares-you-for-a-more-connected-world/)

##### 11. Broaden Your Perspective

A new year means it’s time to expand your comfort zone by trying new things, right? Well, online learning can be a great way to do this! For example, try taking an elective course in something you’ve never studied before! Not only will you learn something new, you’ll also earn a credit that can go on your resume! Engaging in e-learning can be a great way to broaden your perspective on topics you thought you knew, too! With a platform, e-learning encourages students from all backgrounds to share their views in online forums.

##### 12. Furthering Your Education is *Never* A Bad Idea!

Whether it’s improving your marks for post-secondary, shifting your career path, or just for interest’s sake, taking a course online is always worth your while! Investing in yourself and your education is an expense that will pay dividends down the line.
