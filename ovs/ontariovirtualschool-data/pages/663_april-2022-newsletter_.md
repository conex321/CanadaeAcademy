# Midterm Season Is Upon Us

![OUAC MIDTERMS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/Copy-of-Copy-of-OUAC-MIDTERMS-2.jpg)The [OUAC](https://www.ouac.on.ca/) midterm collection period is fast approaching. High school seniors are hard a work getting grades in to apply to post-secondary institutions. At OVS, our students need to submit their required midterm work by **APRIL 15th** if they want to get their midterm submitted before the official last day of the OUAC collection period.

When requesting a midterm grade make sure you remember to inform us you would like your grades uploaded to OUAC. In order to upload grades as a [101 applicant](https://www.ouac.on.ca/ouac-101/) to OUAC you need to add “Ontario Virtual School” as an alternate school in the “Academic Information” section of your OUAC account.

If you’re applying as a [105 student](https://www.ouac.on.ca/ouac-105/), make sure to provide us with the information we need to send grades to your applicant schools, this would include the name of the school, your student number, and an email address where we can send the grades.

Still need to enroll and get midterm marks? Even though enrolling this late will mean you cannot get your midterm grades completed in time for the official [OUAC deadline](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ouac-info-updates/), don’t worry. We can still submit midterm grades outside the official collection period.
