The first Ontario University Fair took place in late September, but if you missed that one – not to worry! Another virtual fair will be taking place on:

Tuesday, October 26, from 5-7 pm (ET).

All Ontario universities will be attending this free online fair, and anyone is welcome (even if you’re not applying to university this year!).

The event will be divided up into four 30-minute sessions, where students can learn about the universities of their choice and ask questions to help make informed decisions.

University fairs, whether virtual or in-person, are a great opportunity for students to get answers about programs, admission requirements, student life and much more! To learn more about the OUFs, visit: [www.ontariouniversitiesfair.ca](https://www.ontariouniversitiesfair.ca/).

### Part-time OVS Students:

Your day school will issue your PIN letter at some point in October or early November. Please note that you will only receive ONE PIN letter – OVS cannot issue PIN letters for students who are not officially registered as full-time. Instead, when you create your OUAC account, you will need to [add OVS as an additional school](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/understanding-the-2021-ouac-application/) so our office can update your enrollment/marks as they are processed through the school year.

### Full-time OVS Students:

OVS will issue your PIN letter, along with instructions on creating your OUAC account, by the end of October. Keep an eye out for these email communications and internal notices from our administration and guidance staff.
