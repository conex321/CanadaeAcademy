While most people are still going to a brick-and-mortar school to get an education, there is a brand-new community of students that have started to get their education online. Once you step into this brand-new type of learning atmosphere, you’ll never want to go back to a traditional style of learning again. [Virtual schools](/about-us/) give you the opportunity to expand your horizons and pace yourself correctly as you make your way towards a degree. **How Online Schools Work** It’s really quite simple to get started with an online education. Simply fill out the easy registration form and we’ll send you an email that comes directly from the teacher. You’ll be welcomed to the course and you can then start your studying at any time. You don’t have to attend school during daytime hours – you’ll have the freedom to choose your own schedule. All of your [lessons will be available online](/register-online/) in the form of a PowerPoint presentation. These lessons are all engaging and stimulating and contain real-life simulations, videos and animations. Homework and quizzes are provided so that the student can be sure that he is understanding all of the material. Teachers are always available to offer support and can be contacted at any time. If you need help with a video presentation, project, an essay or any of the other assignments that may be required, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with your teacher. Our school fosters a nurturing and supportive environment for all of our students.
