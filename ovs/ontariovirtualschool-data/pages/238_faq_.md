When you are ready you can complete the unit evaluations and submit them into the drop box for your teacher to evaluate and provide feedback. All unit evaluations are completed and submitted online. You can type out your answers, do them on paper and scan them or take a picture of your handwritten work as submission of the evaluations, whatever means you are comfortable with. After you receive a grade and feedback, you can then proceed to the next unit and so forth until the course is complete. At the mid-point in the course, we will mail you a first report card, and upon completion of the remaining units and the [proctored final exam](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/final-exams/)you will be mailed a final report card.

### How do I know if online learning is right for me?

Students should be motivated to excel, have familiarity with basic computer applications (word processer, web browser), and possess the ability to work independently. Remember there is also an Ontario trained and certified teacher assigned to assist, encourage and communicate with you and will be able to help you achieve your goals in the course.

### How long does it take to do an online course?

One of the greatest features of [online learning](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/online-school/) is the flexibility it provides in allowing you to customize your schedule to complete the course at your own pace. Course progress is measured on the completion of the assignments, discussions and summative evaluations. You can login to your course and [learn at home](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/learnathome/) any time and at any pace. Students are eligible to write the final exam after completing the minimal number of hours. For example: studying a few hours a day will enable you to complete the course in just four weeks. If you require a slower pace you can take up to 12 months to complete a course.

### Can I take a course through OVS in the summer?

Yes, our courses are available year-round, meaning you can register and start anytime! During July and August, all new registrations are eligible to complete in as little as 21 days (as opposed to the standard 30 days minimum completion the other 10 months of the year!)

### What is your Refund Policy?

Please note that there are no refunds through OVS. Students can however request in writing to transfer to another available OVS course within 7 days of their initial registration provided that they have not attempted any of the course evaluations and that they have the prerequisite for the course they wish to transfer into.

### What is a proctored final exam?

Many of our courses require students to write a [final exam](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/final-exams/) at the end of the course. This exam must be written pen-to-paper while in the continuous presence of an approved proctor.

**Who can proctor?**
A proctor is any professional adult who is willing to sit with the student to administer and supervise the writing of the final exam, ensuring that all exam procedures are properly followed. The date, time, location, and proctor are all selected by the student. Proctors must have access to a printer and scanner, and must not be related to the student.

**How are exams scheduled?**
Students enter their proctor’s details, including their professional email address and phone number, into the “Exam” tab of their course at least 3 days in advance of when they would like to write the exam. This request will first be agreed to by the listed proctor; once they have confirmed their willingness to proctor, their information will be forwarded to the teacher for approval. Once approved, the student and proctor can mutually determine the desired date, time, and location of the exam. The student will then enter the date and time into the “Exam” tab and our system will automatically email a copy of the exam and policy form to the proctor 2 hours prior to the scheduled time. The approved proctor and student may then proceed with the final exam as scheduled. Once the final exam has been written, the proctor must send the exam back to the teacher as a scanned, clearly legible document. If a student chooses a proctor who charges a fee for their services, OVS is not responsible for that fee.

### Will OVS send my marks to OUAC/OCAS and my day school?

Upon completion, we will automatically mail a copy of the final report to the day school on file. For students applying to post-secondary, we can also send the marks directly to [OUAC](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ouac-info-updates/), [OCAS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ocas-info-updates/), or to the university if you have applied as a mature student.

**For students applying to university through OUAC**: first: add OVS within the Academic Background section of your OUAC account; then, check off “undergraduate” when requesting your report card.
**For mature applicants**: simply provide the admissions email as well as your student ID with that school in the notes of your request.
**For students applying to colleges through OCAS**: Simply provide your OCAS account number (begins with 2100) when requesting your report card.

### What is the role of the teacher?

The primary responsibility of the teacher is that of a facilitator… one who supports all learners to be successful in the course. Teachers assist student by answering questions via email, monitoring threaded discussions and chat topics, providing valuable feedback on evaluations and providing multiple opportunities to demonstrate learning.

### If I am registered as a full-time or part-time student at a regular high school, can I still take an online credit course with OVS?

Absolutely…. Since Ontario Virtual School is a [private school](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/online-high-school/), students do not require permission from their regularly attended day school or school board to take any course. When you have successfully finished the course with us, we will send you one copy of the report card and a second copy will be forwarded to your day school. Your day school will then add this credit to your ongoing transcript. Upon request, OVS can also forward your marks directly to the [Ontario University Application Centre (OUAC)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ouac-info-updates/). There is no charge for this service. All [OSSD](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ossd-requirements/) high school credits are the same regardless of means of delivery.

### Are there any hidden or additional costs?

There are absolutely no hidden or additional fees! All necessary materials will be provided, either directly in the lesson attachments (e.g., worksheets and homework tasks) or in a course resource tab (e.g., course texts, practice evaluations, and assessments rubrics). Courses only require students have access to a word processing program, such as Microsoft Word.

### What do I need to get started?

You will need a computer, tablet, or cellphone with high-speed internet; however, our course content runs better on a PC or Mac. (Please see the PC requirements tab). Please read our [Privacy Policy](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/privacy-policy/).
