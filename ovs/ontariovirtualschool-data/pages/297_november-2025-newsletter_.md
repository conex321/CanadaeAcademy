> This scholarship from OVS would be a huge help for my university studies. My parents have always supported me and covered all my expenses as an athlete, and I’m truly grateful for that. Now that I’m starting university, I want to ease their financial burden and take some of the pressure off. This support would allow me to give back to them and focus fully on my education and goals.

Alexandra is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Music Honours in Music Education at [Western University](https://www.uwo.ca/index.html).

> I’ve been teaching music and drama for the last two years in my life, and I feel a degree in music education is the natural progression. A music education degree teaches me to conduct and play all types of instruments (woodwinds, brass, string etc) while also enforcing pedagogy and strategies for ensemble learning. The conducting is particularly important as it is only available in the music education stream, and I hope to conduct professionally one day.
