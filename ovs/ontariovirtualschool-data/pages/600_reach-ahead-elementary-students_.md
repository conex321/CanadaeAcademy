## The Reach Ahead Program

Ontario Virtual School is a Ministry-inspected private school offering high school credits in a fully online format. We are authorized “Reach Ahead” school, which means that we allow students currently in their Grade 8 year to “reach ahead” by taking up to three Grade 9 credits – with permission from their day school.

### The Reach Ahead Program is a fabulous opportunity for current Grade 8 students to:

* Reduce the academic demand in their first year of high school by already having completed a mandatory course
* Ease the transition from the elementary into secondary schooling
* Recognize and prepare for the rigor of high school courses
* Complete a compulsory course prior to the start of high school, allowing greater choice of elective courses to enrich the grade 9 learning experience

This program is only open to students currently in their grade 8 year or those who are in the summer prior to the start of their grade 9 year. To be eligible, prospective reach ahead students must download the form above and submit it to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) prior to registration.

Upon successful completion of our reach ahead course, an official report card will be mailed to your prospective high school, notifying them that the course has been completed in advance.
