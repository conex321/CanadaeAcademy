Notice from OUAC:
Ontario Universities’ Info 2021 is live! Find and compare Ontario university programs, and research residences, scholarships, admission requirements and more.

New this year: We have expanded OUInfo to become the primary online resource for researching Ontario universities. OUInfo now highlights Ontario university virtual events and tours, webinars, chats, videos and more. Students can also request to receive information directly from Ontario universities.

OUInfo is the only resource that is updated directly by the Ontario universities. Universities post updates to OUInfo throughout the year – check back regularly. Visit: www.ontariouniversitiesinfo.ca.

Find more information about Extenuating Circumstances on the Guidance website.
