With summer coming to a close and a new school year starting, there are many updates and changes happening in the Ontario school system, and some fresh new updates for OVS as well.

## New Courses

OVS is continuing to grow, allowing more students to achieve a high-quality education online from anywhere in the world. We have expanded our Grade 7 and 8 courses, allowing younger students to become full-time online and get an education that suits their needs.

## Grade 7 and 8 French

[Grade 7 Core French](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/fra7g/) provides students with the opportunity to use their previous knowledge and apply new vocabulary and writing conventions by exploring topics related to the global French speaking community.

 As beginning language learners, they will learn new vocabulary that will help them describe their daily life, express themselves using formal and informal conventions, describe their hobbies and interests, learn vocabulary related to travelling, and learn about French-speaking communities around the world.

The aim of [Grade 8 French](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/fra8g/) is to provide students with the necessary skills in all three strands of the French language. Students will develop their ability to read simple texts, write short responses and express personal details and opinions orally.

Students will be required to learn various grammar concepts in order to familiarize themselves with the different parts of a sentence, as well as proper sentence structure. Students will be exposed to new vocabulary corresponding to the different units, and will have multiple opportunities to listen and speak in French.

## Grade 7 Health and Physical Education

[Grade 7 Health and Physical Education](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/ppl7g/) equips students with the knowledge and skills they need to make healthy choices now and lead healthy, active lives in the future. Through participation in a wide range of physical activities, students develop knowledge and skills related to movement competence and personal fitness that provide a foundation for active living.

Students also acquire an understanding of the factors and skills that contribute to healthy development and learn how their own well-being is affected by, and affects, the world around them.

## New High School Graduation requirements

The [Ministry of Education](https://www.ontario.ca/page/high-school-graduation-requirements) has made some significant changes to the requirements for the OSSD, to be phased in as of this September 2024. These changes will only go into effect for students entering Grade 9 this September 2024, and will not affect any students already in high school at the grades 10-12 level – pre-existing students will continue to complete the pre-existing OSSD requirements in place at the time they entered.

Summer McIntosh has been an [OVS student since 2020](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/student-spotlight/summer-mcintosh/). She has been steadily working through her high school courses while simultaneously dedicating her time and effort towards her training schedule.

Summer swam to gold this year in the 2024 Paris Olympics and we couldn’t be more proud.

 All of us at [OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/) couldn’t be more excited to watch Summer at the Olympics. We’re cheering her on and are incredible proud to be a small part in helping her on her Olympic journey!

## Reaching Ahead

For students entering into Grade 8 this year, there is an option to become a Reach Ahead student with OVS.

The Reach Ahead program is for students in Grade 8 who might be a little more advanced in certain subject areas who are looking to have their minds challenged, as well as getting ahead in their high school studies.

In this program, students can take a maximum of 3 Grade 9 credits during their Grade 8 school year. They have to have permission from the principal at their elementary school to be considered for the program.
