Future goals: After graduation, I plan to pursue my CFA designation. I have taken the necessary steps at Laurier to ensure my success with this goal.

Scholarships you received: I received an entrance bursary during my first semester due to having a 90% average upon acceptance.

How did OVS help you move closer to your goals: OVS was essentially responsible for teaching material at a very high level which resulted in me achieving a 90% overall average. This evidently led to my acceptance at Laurier and receiving the scholarship. The content learned at OVS also helped me dramatically, it was relevant content that I used throughout my 4 years at University.
