The best way to understand the OVS online learning experience is to try it out! The sample lessons below let you do just that. While it varies by course and grade level, a given course can be made up of as many as 50 lessons. All lessons are online, voice narrated, and interactive. Take one of our sample lessons for a test drive to get a feel for the real experience. Please keep in mind that some features have been disabled to make the samples work outside of the online school itself, or to allow us to maintain academic integrity.

Most of [our courses](/courses/) have sample lessons available to be viewed under their course description.
