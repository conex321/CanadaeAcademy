# **Before You Hit Send: Netiquette Tips for OVS Students**

            At some point or another, we’ve all had the experience of misinterpreting the tone of an email or text message. Whether it is due to lack of punctuation, a questionable word choice, poor organisation or confusing sentence structure, it can sometimes be challenging to communicate effectively through email. This is why “netiquette” is an important component of teaching and learning at [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/about-us/) and is part of online high school success.

### **Understanding Etiquette**

            Before delving into the term “netiquette”, let’s take a look at the word “etiquette”. In his research paper [*Netiquette: Fundamentals of Etiquette in Digital Communication*](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3c93/fcaaa186715f095fbccf44d666bb186e1282.pdf), Dr. Uğur Oral defines etiquette as “the rule of respect and courtesy that should be shown sensitivity in interpersonal relationships”. What is more, he describes etiquette as a boomerang, suggesting that the way a person treats those around them is the same way in which they are treated by others.

### **Internet + Etiquette = Netiquette**

Similarly, according to [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-life-hacks/privacy-and-safety/what-is-netiquette), netiquette refers to Internet etiquette and it describes the “ideal pattern of behaviour for Internet users”. Just like we have a set of cultural norms and expectations when interacting face-to-face, the same concept of guidelines apply when communicating online.

### **The Importance of Netiquette**

Since digital interactions have become more frequent than face-to-face interactions for many people, as pointed out in the [International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction](https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_AC6B19A69A7B.P001/REF.pdf), it is imperative that we prioritize clear and respectful communication online. When communicating digitally, it is easy to forget that there is another person on the receiving end of text-based communication, and we may have to put extra effort into ensuring that we are considerate of others’ feelings and possible misinterpretations.

### **Netiquette at OVS**

At Ontario Virtual School, we want to prepare students for communication in an increasingly digital world. Effective email communication with teachers and administrators is not only an essential skill for success in online courses such as [ENG4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4u/) or [MDM4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mdm4u/), but also for future employability. What is more, OVS Staff recognize that “people require communication to create social cohesion, educate younger generations, and express countless emotions, thoughts, and needs” ([Oral, 2025, p. 833](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3c93/fcaaa186715f095fbccf44d666bb186e1282.pdf)) and we want our students to feel safe and understood on our online learning platform.

### **Netiquette for Emails**

When composing and forwarding emails to [helpful OVS staff and instructors](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/meet-our-staff/), here are some ways in which netiquette can be applied:

|  |
| --- |
| ***Your Email Address***: Use your official email address that is on file for all communications.  ***Subject line***: Always include a clear subject line that identifies the reason for your email.  ***Attachments***: Ensure that all documents you attach are labelled clearly for tracking purposes.  ***Greeting***: Be sure you are properly addressing the person you are emailing.  ***Font:*** Use a professional font and refrain from using multiple colours, symbols, or emojis.  ***Itemized Questions:*** Instead of sending separate emails for each question you might have, you may simply itemize your questions/concerns in one email.  ***Length:*** Be sure to make the content of your email as concise as possible, without being so brief as to be rude or uninformative.  ***Response Time Expectations:*** All OVS instructors are bound to a 24-hour response time for student inquiries, Monday to Friday and does not include holidays. |
