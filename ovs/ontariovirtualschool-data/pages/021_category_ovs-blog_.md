So, after ample research and reading several reviews of current and former Ontario Virtual School (OVS) students you’ve decided to make the move to online learning. Welcome, we are glad you’re here! Our community of online learners and educators have undergone a similar transition and are always here to help!

The idea of the university is far from new. It dates back to the Middle Ages, when some of the world’s first centres of higher learning took shape in cities like Paris, Bologna, Montpellier, Oxford, and Salamanca. Closer to home, the oldest institution of higher learning in Canada dates back to 1663, with the Université of Laval having been founded by the Séminaire de Québec. Since that time, the desire for higher learning has flourished. Today Canada currently has 97 public universities with over 16,000 university programs to choose from. What is more, 9 Canadian universities are in the top 200 in the world, including 4 in the top 100!

Canada is known around the world for having school systems that support both high achievement and fair opportunities for students. We also take pride in being a multicultural country, where diversity is valued and protected. Across Canada, education is shaped by important national laws and policies, such as the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, as well as decisions related to child care, language rights, immigration, and Indigenous peoples.

On a recent trip to Ottawa, the capital city of Canada, I was reminded how incredible it is to be a Canadian citizen and how proud I am of the role that Canada plays on the global stage. As I was visiting various tourist attractions and significant sites around the city, I couldn’t help but reflect on all of the connections to the content of various online high school courses offered at Ontario Virtual School and their relevance to shaping students’ sense of identity, both nationally and internationally.

At Ontario Virtual School, we believe in empowering students through learning – and that includes language learning. So before you decide to close the door on studying a new language, take a moment to consider the lifelong benefit it offers. Your future self will thank you.

Here at Ontario Virtual School, we understand the concerns of these families, and want to answer their questions and put their minds at ease. Here are answers to questions we hear from families every day.

At some point or another, we’ve all had the experience of misinterpreting the tone of an email or text message. Whether it is due to lack of punctuation, a questionable word choice, poor organisation or confusing sentence structure, it can sometimes be challenging to communicate effectively through email. This is why “netiquette” is an important component of teaching and learning at Ontario Virtual School and is part of online high school success.

Upon graduating high school, teachers are not only equipping students to earn an Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD), but also to develop a range of skills that will guide them beyond their virtual high school online courses. As technology continues to shape how we learn, work and interact, many of these essential skills are connected to technology use. Whether it is using technology to enhance learning, or understanding how to use it responsibly, digital citizenship has become imperative to student success.

In today’s fast-changing world, it’s not just what students know that matters, but how they think, learn, and problem-solve. In fact, the researchers behind the Institute for Habits of Mind have identified 16 habits that form the basis for the behaviours, skills, and dispositions foundational to effective thinkers. This means that students who practice and hone these skills are more likely to be prepared for unfamiliar situations and more resilient in the real world.

Did you know – that according to UNESCO – there are more than 7000 languages spoken around the world today? With this increased diversity in the linguistic landscape, the need for cross-cultural understanding is more important than ever. While learning an additional language is not a new concept, there is now an increased benefit to learning a new language, as it provides the skills needed to build peace, tolerance and respect for differences both within and outside of the classroom.

Ontario Virtual School offers a variety of courses, including Grade 11 and Grade 12 biology. Both grades offer college-level and university-level, in order to meet the needs of a wide variety of students. Biology is a fantastic subject to study, and a wonderful credit to have on your transcript, but what exactly can you do with it? Why should you study biology at OVS?
