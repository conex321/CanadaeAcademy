# Studying French Immersion While Homeschooling

Kaedance is a homeschool student studying from Saskatchewan. She was worried about losing her French Language skills while homeschooling, so she decided to enroll in French Immersion ([FIF1D](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/fif1d/)) at OVS.

Along with our FIF French Immersion courses, we offer several other courses in the [French Immersions](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/french-immersion/) program, from Business ([BBB4M](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/bbb4mf/)) and History ([CHY4UF](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/chy4uf/)), to Humanities ([HFA4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/hfa4uf/)), Math ([MCR3UF](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mcr3uf/)), and Science ([SCH4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sch4uf/)). We have more than 20 French Immersion course options ranging from Grades 9 to 12.

Kaedance said what she enjoyed most about her course at OVS was the way the platform was organized, making it easy to navigate. She also liked that our pre-recorded lectures had both an audio and visual component to enhance learning. She found the confetti animations when she signed in a nice little touch.

She was excited to see that we are working to expand our French Immersion program and plans to take more French Immersion courses through OVS.
