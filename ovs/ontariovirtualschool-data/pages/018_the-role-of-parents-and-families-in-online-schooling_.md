As [online learning continues to grow](https://www.educationnext.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ednext_XIV_2_mcshane.pdf) in popularity, more students and families are choosing this form of education. However, many families might be unsure of the role they can play in online learning. One of the main advantages of online learning is that parents can be more involved in the learning process. At the same time, online learning provides a valuable opportunity for students to learn and practice independence. These two aspects don’t have be contradictory; in fact, they can complement each other, depending on how parents and families engage in the process.

## Increased Access to Course Content

Although many schools strive to involve parents and families in the learning process, in-person instruction takes place away from the home and parental support, which can make involvement challenging. With online learning, parents can know exactly what their children are studying. For instance, at [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), parents can review any part of a lesson at any time. This accessibility means parents can help their children more thoroughly, through one-on-one discussion, which is sometimes difficult in a crowded classroom. Families know their student best, and children may feel more comfortable asking questions to a parent than of a teacher.

## Collaboration with Teachers

Parents and students are encouraged reach out to teachers at any time with questions or concerns. At OVS, students and parents can email teachers directly and expect a response within one business day. Being aware of the course content allows parents to better prepare for these discussions, helping them address their child’s strengths and needs. This collaboration can ensure that all parties work together to provide the best possible education for the student.

## Monitoring Student Progress

It’s common for students seek their parents’ help to review work before submission, and as long as it isn’t during tests or exams, it can be an effective strategy. Ontario Virtual School allows parents to have a Parent Portal, so that they have complete access to their child’s course and can monitor their progress. Since parents of online students can see exactly how far along their children are in any particular course, they can better help their children stay on track, both by ensuring schedules are kept, and that students are consistently putting forward their best efforts. While parents should avoid introducing new concepts into students’ work, their access to course material allows them to identify mistakes, enabling students to correct them more easily.

## Fostering Independence

Despite the increased involvement parents can have in online learning, it is important to recognize when students are ready to work independently. Online education offers excellent opportunities for fostering independence. With the ability to review lessons at their own pace or connect with their teachers in their own words, students learn to rely more on their own skills, an essential part of their transition into adulthood. When parents observe their children working independently, encouraging this behaviour significantly benefits their long-term development – and it might make things easier for parents as well.

Ultimately, online learning doesn’t have to feel vastly different from traditional education for parents. It provides an easier way for them to support their children while also creating more opportunities for independence.
