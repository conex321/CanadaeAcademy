## Fundamental Concepts Covered in Grade 12 Chemistry Online Course

This course enables students to develop an understanding of chemistry through the study of matter and qualitative analysis, organic chemistry, electrochemistry, chemical calculations, and chemistry as it relates to the quality of the environment. Students will use a variety of laboratory techniques, develop skills in data collection and scientific analysis, and communicate scientific information using appropriate terminology.

## Online Teaching and Learning Strategies

Teachers will bring enthusiasm and varied teaching and assessment approaches to the classroom, addressing individual students’ needs and ensuring sound learning opportunities for every student. The activities offered should enable students to relate and apply these concepts to the social, environmental, and economical conditions and concerns of the world in which they live. Opportunities to relate knowledge and skills to these wider contexts will motivate students to learn in a meaningful way and to become life-long learners. Teachers will help students understand that problem solving of any kind often requires a considerable expenditure of time and energy and a good deal of perseverance. Teachers also will encourage students to investigate, to reason, to explore alternative solutions and to take the risks necessary to become successful problem solvers. Effective instructional approaches and learning activities draw on students’ prior knowledge, capture their interest, and encourage meaningful practise both inside and outside the classroom. Students will be engaged when they are able to see the connection between the scientific concepts they are learning and their application in the world around them and in real-life situations. Due to its importance, students will have opportunities to learn in a variety of ways- individually, cooperatively, independently, with teacher direction, through hands-on experiences, and through examples followed by practice. The approaches and strategies teachers use will vary according to both the object of the learning and the needs of the students. Teachers will accomplish this in online environment with the use of: virtual labs, online simulations, animations, videos, discussion forums, live chat and other interactive objects.

## Assessment & Evaluation

As summarized in [Growing Success 2010](http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/success.html), the primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning. Information gathered through assessment helps teachers to determine students’ strengths and weaknesses and adapt curriculum and instructional approaches accordingly.

As part of assessment, teachers provide students with descriptive feedback to help guide their learning Evaluation refers to the process of measuring the quality of work against an established criteria, and assigning a value representative of work quality. All curriculum expectations must be accounted for in instruction, but evaluation focuses on students’ achievement of the overall expectations.

A students’ achievement is evaluated in relation to specific expectations. Teachers use their professional judgement to determine which specific expectations should be used to evaluate achievement of overall expectations, and which ones will be covered in instruction and assessment but not used as an evaluation benchmark. To ensure assessment and evaluation are valid and fair teachers use assessment and evaluation strategies that:

* Address both what students learn and how well they learn
* Are based on the achievement level descriptions given in the achievement chart
* Are varied in nature, administered over time, and designed to provide opportunities for students to demonstrate the full range of their learning
* Are appropriate for the learning activities used, the purposes of instruction, and the needs and experiences of the students
* Are fair to all students
* Accommodate students with special education needs, consistent with the strategies outlined in their Individual Education Plan
* Accommodate the needs of students who are learning the language of instruction
* Ensure that each student is given clear directions for improvement
* Promote students’ ability to assess their own learning and to set specific goals
* Include student work samples as evidence their achievement
* Are communicated clearly to students and parents at the beginning of the school year and at other appropriate points throughout the school year.

The achievement chart outlines four categories of knowledge and skills:

1. Knowledge and understanding
2. Critical thinking
3. Communication
4. Application

Teachers assess and/or evaluate work in a balanced manner with respect to the four categories. A final grade is recorded, and a credit is granted and recorded for this course if the student’s grade is 50% or higher. The final grade for this course will be determined as follows:

**Seventy percent of the grade** is based on evaluations conducted throughout the course. This portion of the grade reflects the student’s most consistent level of achievement throughout the course, although special consideration should be given to more recent evidence of achievement.

**Thirty percent of the grade** is based on a final evaluation and administered towards the end of the course.

## Special Accommodations for Students with an IEP

Every single student is capable of success. Some students are able, with certain [accommodations](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/iep-accommodations/), to participate in the regular course curriculum and demonstrate independent learning.

[Accommodations](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/iep-accommodations/) allow access to the course without any changes to the [knowledge and skills the student is expected to demonstrate](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/assessment-evaluation/). The accommodations required to facilitate the student’s learning are identified by the teacher. Recommendations from a School Board generated [Individual Education Plan (IEP)](https://www.specialeducationguide.com/pre-k-12/individualized-education-programs-iep/the-iep-process-explained/) if available can also be consulted. Instruction based on principles of universal design and differentiated make it possible to meet the diverse needs of all learners.

**Examples of accommodations (but not limited to) include:**

* Adjusting or extending assessment deadlines
* Providing alternative assignments or summative tasks
* Use of scribes and/or other assistive technologies
* Simplifying the language of instruction

I decided to take this course through a friend's recommendation, who told me that it was a great experience. Despite that, I was still a bit unsure but decided to take a leap of faith and purchase the course. It was an amazing decision because this was the best way for me to achieve a high mark and thorough understanding of the course content. There were no hidden fees whatsoever, and once you paid the initial amount for the course, that was it. I'm a senior in high school and took MHF4U and it was a great experience. The lessons were easy to follow along and understand, and the workload was a breeze as well, considering how exceptional the teaching was. The Unit Tests were also very simple to follow along, especially with the phenomenal lessons and organization. I was also pleasantly surprised with the response time through emails, as it was very fast, with teachers and administrators. I also received my report cards very quickly, after submitting my request through the site. Plus, when I received marked work back, it was easy to follow along and helpful to see what I needed to work on. Overall, this was an absolutely awesome experience and i'd definitely recommend that anyone who is on the fence about taking an online course should for sure do it with OVS!

My experience taking online courses with OVS was phenomenal! I took grade 12 Advanced Functions MHF4U and my teacher was Mr. Currie. He was extremely quick with responding to any of my questions and marking my tests, discussion posts and lab simulations. The corrections were always sent to me within 24h, even on the weekends! The course lessons were easy to follow and were delivered in an organized fashion. Doing the course at my own pace allowed me to achieve unmatched success. I would highly recommend OVS to any students interested in following the Ontario curriculum who are looking to "reach ahead" in their high school studies.

My experience with Ontario Virtual School exceeded all my expectations! I had Ms. Farooq when I took grade 12 Chemistry (SCH4U). The teaching and the support of the teacher was amazing! It was my first time taking an asynchronous course so I had some doubts at first, but those quickly went away when I saw how clear and concise the lessons were. There were absolutely no hidden fees which is great! I loved how quickly my teacher Ms. Farooq would mark and hand back my assignments. She would usually hand them back the next day. The admin team of the Ontario Virtual School were also very helpful and were always there to answer any questions I had about the course content, report cards and due dates.
I had an outstanding experience with Ontario Virtual school and highly recommend it!
