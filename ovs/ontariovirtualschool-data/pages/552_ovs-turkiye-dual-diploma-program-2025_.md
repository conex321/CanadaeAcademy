Our most recent partnership has been with the Crown International Education and Consultancy, an organization that has been providing services for over 18 years. Working together OVS and Crown International have been operating the OSSD Canada Dual Diploma Program, in collaboration with reputable Turkish institutions since September 2024.

## About The Program

When schools launch the program, students who wish to join are required to take the ELADD exam, prepared by Precise Testing and Solutions. Students are expected to achieve at least a B2 level according to CEFR standards. Those who achieve B2 proceed to an interview with their parents to evaluate whether they are ready to join the program.

Students who successfully complete the written exam and oral interviews receive an admission letter and are asked to send in all necessary documents to begin the program. Prior to the start of the program, an online orientation meeting is conducted after the enrolment procedure is finished. This meeting is attended by Crown International and OVS officials along with the student and their parents.

Student progress in the program is monitored by the partner school, and coordinators receive updates on their students’ improvement throughout the course. Regular meetings are held with students and their parents to help keep students on track and parents well informed.

Students must complete Grade 12 with OVS, along with meeting other Ontario graduation components such as community service/volunteer hours, and the Ontario Literacy requirement.

Through this program, students in Turkiye can graduate high school earning not only a diploma from their local high school, but also the Ontario Secondary School Diploma through OVS.

In order to promote the dual diploma program Crown International Education has participated in several notable events including a visit to Ms.Tara Scheurwater, the Consul General of Canada in Istanbul, on December 4, 2025, to provide information about our program. They were accompanied by some of our Dual Diploma program students, Ms. Gonca Tasar, the International Education Program Coordinator at our partner school Doga College, and our company’s founder, Mr. Senol Kaya. Ms. Tara Scheurwater engaged in one-on-one conversations with the students to gather insights from them. She also informed the students about prestigious universities in Canada. At the end of the day, she kindly gifted us Canadian lapel pins and small bottles of maple syrup. Her warm and heartfelt behavior, as well as her hospitality, made their visit an incredibly delightful experience.

In February 2025, Crown International attended “Take Your Seat Together; Canada & Turkiye” photo exhibition photo exhibition, graciously hosted by Her Excellency Tara Scheurwater, Consul General of Canada in Istanbul. The exhibition, featuring the stunning work of Canadian photographer Spencer VanDerStarren, captivated guests by showcasing the strikingly similar landscapes of both countries. The invaluable experiences gained by our students will serve as a guiding light throughout their lives.

Also in February, Miss Janet Stickey from Candor Education, along with Crown International Education, visited with numerous schools to promote the Dual Diploma program. During this trip they attended the Dual Diploma Program launch at Ayseabla Schools in Ankara.
