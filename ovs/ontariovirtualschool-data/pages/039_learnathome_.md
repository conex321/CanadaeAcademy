Ontario Virtual School (OVS) is an accredited online virtual high school operating since 2010. Our school has grown to an annual student population of 5000. OVS has been inspected by the Ontario Ministry of Education.   We provide a rich variety of online virtual high school OSSD credit courses leading to an Ontario Secondary School Diploma(OSSD). OVS students register for a wide range of reasons, all of which signal the diversity of needs that OVS is serving. Many of our students are looking to add a few courses in addition to their current school work. Some are striving to upgrade existing marks. We also support mature students, international students, and those who are scheduling around other commitments. Some of our students include elite athletics and professional models.

### Ontario Virtual School and Homeschooling

Some homeschoolers continue their home-based education throughout the high school years with the support of OVS. Ontario Virtual School works closely with the homeschooler’s parents to meet their child’s educational goals.

> OVS was the best choice for us! They helped my son and daughter to attain marks required for the university admission. We had experience with the grade 12 biology, chemistry, and math teachers who were highly supportive, considerate, flexible, and accommodating. They put their best effort to help kids attain their goals by keeping them motivated and responding quickly to their emails. The admin staff is very polite, knowledgeable and guide you on the right track. We highly recommend OVS to those looking to earn online credits.
