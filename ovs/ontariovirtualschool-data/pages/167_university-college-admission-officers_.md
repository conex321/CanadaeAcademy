## 1. Do you have applicants who are missing prerequisite entry requirements?

OVS offers all the prerequisite courses required for university and college admissions.

> I took grade 12 Physics and English through Ontario Virtual School and both times I felt that the practical application of things learned was an emphasis. I think a big part of this journey with OVS was getting prepared for university. – Wajiha Fatima Syeda (Ryerson University, Occupational & Public Health)

Many parents and students continue to recommend OVS; [their kind words](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/recommendations-students-parents/) humble us.

## 2. How we can help your applicants with conditional acceptance?

The end of the school year is approaching! Some of your applicants have not met the conditions of their acceptance and are at risk of not being admitted into the program of their choice.

Applicants can complete a course in as little as four weeks to satisfy their prerequisites in our self-paced online course with the support of an Ontario Certified Teacher.

> Towards the end of my grade 12 year, I had limited time to complete a course in order to keep my university acceptance. Ontario Virtual School helped me get the course done and do well! – Stephanie Sassi

We are grateful to the many parents and students who have shared their experiences and how we’ve consistently exceeded their expectations. OVS has [over 80 “5-Star” reviews on Google.](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/recommendations-students-parents/)

## 3. Do your international student applicants need unique support?

Time zones are never a problem with 24/7 access to courses from anywhere in the world. We also do not require study permits.

International students have told us they value our dedicated, certified teachers for their:

* Knowledge and patience – in particular for those with limited English skills.
* Accessibility by phone, text, email, Skype, and yes, FaceTime
* Flexible hours for support, i.e. beyond 8 am – 8 pm EST

> I presumed that the time difference would impact my ability to communicate with my teachers and receive proper help, however that was not the case. My teachers were helpful and effective in helping me achieve academic success. – Matt Elliotts, studying from China

> In grade 12, I was studying in Punjab, India in the C.B.S.E Board’s medical stream. Then I realized that I had to complete a grade 12 math course in order to receive admission into a B.Sc. program at a Canadian university. This was a difficult predicament for me, either I had to study one more year to complete the math course or forget about studying in Canada. Then one of the university advisers showed me the path; Ontario Virtual School. I completed my math requirements with OVS, and in the end, I was accepted by all eight of the Ontario universities that I applied to. – Manreet Singh Boparai

Our teachers have supported and guided many international students from China, India, South Korea, Egypt, France, Turkey, Japan and the U.S. – just to name a few!

## 4. How do you resolve inflated marks?

You may recall Global News featured story in September 2018, [Secret list to judge applicants by their high schools – not just their marks.](https://globalnews.ca/news/4405495/waterloo-engineering-grade-inflation-list/) Dr. Greg Moran former Provost and Vice President Academics at the University of Western has stated for many years:

> Grading inconsistency between schools is a massive problem.

Key takeaways:

* Students with inflated marks risk being placed into programs for which they are not well prepared.
* The perception that the admission’s team is being unfair to graduates of schools with more rigorous marking standards.

As an Admissions Officer, we appreciate you can’t always take marks completely at face value. Moran has advocated that Admissions Officers “*need informed decision-making.*” To help minimize grade inflation some officers \* have recommended that Canadian and international applicants repeat a course with OVS. Our upgrade courses allow students to improve their understanding of the curriculum, while improving their overall mark. Each grade 12 course covers the same Ministry expectations as the original course.

> OVS online high school allowed me to upgrade my original English mark to a more university-required grade. The whole process was amazing and well worth the money. I would most definitely recommend this service to anyone looking to enroll in an online school.  – Tyler Satino, Queen’s University, Economics, Athletic & Admission Scholarships

Rely on OVS to help support you in your decision-making.
