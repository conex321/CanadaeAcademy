“One of my future long-term goals is to run for either Member of parliament or provincial parliament. I truly want to give back to the community that helped me become a person I am today.”

A community-minded person, Pvitar is proud of his roots. “BRAMPTON BABY… BORN AND RAISED!!” He’s thankful for the opportunities his community has afforded him in life.

“I believe I was raised in an amazing environment, and I love helping others. This is one reason I participate in various community organizations, such as the [SEVA food bank](https://www.sevafoodbank.com/).”

This love for his community drives him to work hard and make sure he can make a positive difference in the world.

“I truly want to give back to the community that helped me become a person I am today. Being a politician is part of a larger goal of becoming the premier of Ontario. As the premier, I would want to improve the education and healthcare system in Ontario.”

Pvitar knows this is a lofty goal, one that would take a lot of hard work and careful planning. But Pvitar has been planning his future and working toward it for a long time. From childhood summers working on his father’s farm, to his upcoming studies at [McMaster University for their Business One program](https://future.mcmaster.ca/programs/business/), Pvitar has consistently taken steps to make sure that he is always pushing himself to further success.

“I don’t watch many movies because I believe I just end up wasting valuable time doing nothing.”

That drive to make the most of his time brought Pvitar to [OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), where our Learning Management System allowed him to balance his education with his employment while he earned credits for two Grade 12 courses, [Mathematics of Data Management](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mdm4u/), and [English](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4u/).

“I currently work at a warehouse in which I drive a forklift. The online platform let me work at my schedule and gave me the initiative to balance my time wisely.”

With this freedom and control over his own studies, and his own time, Pvitar was able to make the most of his time, and not only to achieve, but to exceed his academic goals.

“As of today, I can gladly say I got into all the programs I applied to. This includes Laurier (BBA), Schulich (BBA) and McMaster (Business One).”

Pvitar is well on his way to success, and we here at [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/) are proud to count him among our alumni.

“Ontario virtual school was a creative platform that allowed me to excel due to my ability to choose when to work on it. Teachers were friendly and went out of their way to help. I would highly recommend Ontario virtual school due to my experience!”
