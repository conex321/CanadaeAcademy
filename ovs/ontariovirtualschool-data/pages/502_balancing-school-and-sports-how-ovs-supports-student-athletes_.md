**Source:** https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/balancing-school-and-sports-how-ovs-supports-student-athletes
**Description:** Being a high-performance athlete require intense training, focus, and dedication. When you’re still in high school, you also have the added stress of classes, studying, and passing your exams. Doing both can be overwhelming, and often students find themselves either struggling in school or having a hard time maintaining their training for their sport.  With OVS, students don’t have to give anything up and can succeed in both their academics and their athletics. Students can customize their education to fit their needs, giving them more freedom to pursue their goals.
