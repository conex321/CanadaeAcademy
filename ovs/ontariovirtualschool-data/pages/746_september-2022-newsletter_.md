![September Newsletter Full-Time](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/Graphic-2.jpg)

Are you a student who finds regular day school programs don’t work for you? Do you have a lot of extra curriculars like sports, acting, or work that make regular full-time programs difficult to keep up with? Maybe you’re a parent who is interested in homeschooling but doesn’t have the time to teach your teen?

With OVS, you can sign up as a full-time student and never have to attend a regular day school. You can customize your learning to fit your schedule, watching lessons, and handing in assignments when it works best for you.

As a parent, you can rest assured that your teen is getting a quality education from the comfort of home. There is an [Ontario Certified teacher](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/meet-our-staff/) attached to each course that students can reach out to if they need help. We also have a student support team that monitors student activity and will reach out if they notice students aren’t active in their courses. You can be confident that OVS will help your child succeed.

## OUAC

For senior students, this year is incredibly important when it comes to planning your future. Maybe you’ve already given it a lot of thought and know exactly what you’re planning to do after graduation, or you could just be figuring it out. Either way, knowing your options is important.

## French Immersion

![French Immersion](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/pexels-pixabay-resize.jpg)

At Ontario virtual school, students are able to take [French Immersion](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/learn-french-immersion/) courses. In a country that is known for having two official languages, French is often underserved in many schools.

At OVS we offer the FIF [French Immersion](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/fif4u/) courses in Grades 9 through 12. We also have a variety of other subjects in French Immersion such as [business](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/bbb4mf/), [math](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mcr3uf/), [science](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sch4uf/), [humanities](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/hfa4uf/), [history](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/chy4uf/) and [geography](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/cgc1df/). So, if your current school doesn’t offer French Immersion OVS has got you covered.

## International Languages

Along with French there are all kinds of [international languages](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/learn-another-language-this-summer-like-french-or-computer-coding/) that students can learn at OVS. Being able to communicate in more than one language has many benefits, especially given the global interconnectivity of today’s society.

We offer advanced language courses in [Farsi](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/lyfdu/) (Persian), [Hindi](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/lihdu/), [Spanish](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/lwsdu/), [Punjabi](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/lipdu/), [Mandarin](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/lkbdu/), and [Korean](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/lkkdu/).
