**OVS IS PROUD TO UNVEIL OUR *FREE* GRADE 9 MATH PREPARATION COURSE!**

This new course offering presents a fantastic opportunity for Grade 8 students to familiarize themselves with the foundational concepts needed to successfully make the transition into high school mathematics, with a certified teacher available to help them along the way.

With the introduction of this course, OVS hopes to address the existing math gap between elementary and secondary level math, while at the same time supporting the government’s eLearning initiative by allowing elementary students to develop their ability to learn in an online learning environment.

Hi, my name is Ms. Crognale and I’m a new teacher with OVS!

In my spare time, you’ll almost always find me with a book in hand or watching the latest TV series.

I also spend a lot of time outdoors taking my Goldendoodle, Conrad, on new adventures!

**Ms. Crognale is currently accepting new students for ENG4U.**
