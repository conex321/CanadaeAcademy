### Policy Overview

The Assessment and Evaluation Policy for Ontario Virtual School is consistent with Ministry policy and reflects our aforementioned vision that the primary purpose of assessment is to improve student learning. Assessment is the process of gathering information that accurately reflects how well a student is achieving the curriculum expectations in a subject or course. Assessment for the purpose of improving student learning is seen as both “assessment for learning” and “assessment as learning”. As part of assessment for learning, teachers provide students with descriptive feedback and coaching for improvement in future assessments. Teachers engage in assessment as learning by helping students develop their capacity to be independent, self-directed learners who are able to set individual goals, monitor their own progress, determine next steps, and self-reflect. Ongoing per-assessments and formative assessments will be used to provide meaningful feedback as to student progress and achievement in order to improve performance. Summative assessments will be used to determine an overall grade in the course.

### Course Evaluation

Ontario Virtual School adheres to the assessment & evaluation practices as outlined in the Ministry of Education’s Growing Success document. The final mark for each course will be divided into two parts: 1. 70% will be based on the cumulative evidence of summative evaluations undertaken throughout the semester “Term Work” 2. 30% will be based on summative evaluations taking place in the final third of the course. “Final Summatives” Final summatives may or may not include an exam, depending on individual course curriculum policy documents. At the beginning of the course, students will receive course outlines detailing the course’s specific assessment and evaluation information.

### Withdrawing from a Course

* A withdrawal from any Grade 11 or 12 course occurring **within** 5 days of the first report card being issued will result in the mark **not** being recorded on the OST.
* A withdrawal from any Grade 11 or 12 course occurring **after** 5 days of the first report card being issued will result in a “W” being entered in the “Credit” column of the OST, along with the mark at the time of the withdrawal.
* Withdrawals from Grade 9 or 10 courses are never recorded on the OST, regardless of when they occur.
* If there are extraordinary circumstances relating to a student’s withdrawal from a course, an “S” may be entered in the “Note” column on the OST.

### Repetition of a Course

* When a course is repeated, only one course attempt will earn credit towards the 30 credits required for an OSSD.
* In Grades 11 and 12, both courses must be recorded on the OST, with an “R” appearing next to the course session with the lower grade.

### Course Transfer Policy

A student who registers and is enrolled into a course for less than one week (7 days) and does not complete an assessment in that course, may request to be transferred to another course, at no additional cost to the student. Each student will only be granted one free course transfer. All course transfer requests must be received by OVS administration within one week of the initial enrollment. The decision of the OVS administration will be considered final in all cases involving student requests for course transfers made after this period.

### Reporting Student Achievement

Ontario Virtual School will use the Provincial Report Card, Grades 9-12, for formal written reports mailed to the student’s listed home address twice over the duration the student is active in the course. The first report reflects student achievement of the overall curriculum expectations during the first reporting period, as well as development of the learning skills and work habits. The final report reflects achievement of the overall expectations for the entire course, as well as development of the learning skills and work habits.

### Learning Skills

### Individual Education Plan (IEP)

Ontario Virtual School does not conduct IPRC for enrolled students. However, teachers will use assessments to determine the student’s individual needs and accommodate accordingly to ensure student success. Parents are encouraged to maintain ongoing communication with teachers to support the student’s progress throughout the course.

### English Language Learners

When curriculum expectations are modified to meet the needs of language-learning needs of English language Learners (ELL’s), assessment and evaluation will be based on the documented modified expectations. Teachers, in collaboration with the principal, will determine the most effective way to document the modification of curriculum expectations for English Language Learners. Modification of some or all of the curriculum expectations may be required to support English Language Learners, particularly those who are in the early stages of learning English or those who have limited prior schooling.

### Accommodations related to learning resources, such as:

* extensive use of visual materials
* use of adapted texts and bilingual dictionaries
* use of dual-language materials
* use of technology

### Accommodations related to assessment strategies, such as:

* allowance of extra time
* use of alternative assessment strategies (e.g., oral interviews, learning logs, or portfolios)
* use of simplified language and instructions
