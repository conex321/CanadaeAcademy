## Student Spotlight: Mature Student Samantha Kaszas Returns to Prepare for Post-Secondary & Discovers Talent for Creative Writing

Meet Samantha! After more than a decade in the workforce, she decided to return to the [virtual] classroom and set her sights on pursuing post-secondary. Along the way, thanks to the urging of her Creative Writing teacher, Samantha entered online writing contests and found great success, so much so that her prize money began to fund her tuition!

> I never would’ve started to submit my writing at this point if it hadn’t been for the course and I am so happy I did. […] The contests pay cash prizes, so I have been saving any money I have made from the site and putting it away for my university education. […] OVS has been a great stepping stone for me and I feel much more confident about pursuing post-secondary now.
