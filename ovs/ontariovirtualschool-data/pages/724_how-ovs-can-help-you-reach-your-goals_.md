At Ontario Virtual School, we are committed to helping all students reach their goals. Whether you are looking to get an [OSSD](https://www.ontario.ca/page/high-school-graduation-requirements) and enter the workforce or if you plan on going forward to a post-secondary program, we can help you get there.

## Student Life Expo

The [Student Life Expo](https://studentlifeexpo.com/) in Toronto, which takes place every fall at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre, is intended to give students all kinds of information to make decisions about their future. From university and college programs, to information on careers, scholarships, travel and more.

This year OVS was excited to attend the event and connect with students about their futures and how OVS can support them. With [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/faq/), students are able to get the high school credits they need to move forward on their chosen pathway, wherever that path may lead.

We offer the entire Ontario High School curriculum, including many [French Immersion](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/french-immersion/) courses, to help students earn the credits they need to graduate and join the workforce, attend college, or go to university.

## Workforce

![How OVS Can Help You Reach Your Goals](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/IMG_20221202_143616.jpg)

Perhaps you’re a current high school student and know that you want to enter the workforce right away, or maybe you’re not sure what you want to do yet but want to graduate and work while you figure it out. Maybe you’re a [Mature Student](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/adult-students/) who has been working for quite some time, but never graduated high school and now need to earn a diploma for further career opportunities. Whatever the reason, if you’re a student looking to get an OSSD in order to enter the workforce, OVS is happy to work with you in order to meet your needs.
