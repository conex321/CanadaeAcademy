Ontario Virtual School has recently partnered with the Canadian International School of Afghanistan. CISOA is a virtual school that provides the Ontario Secondary School Diploma for girls in Afghanistan. The school was created in response to the Taliban closure of schools for girls.

Our principal Gary Michael was invited to the ribbon cutting grand opening ceremony which took place in Toronto and addressed the group of community members, donors, sponsors and dignitaries.  The purpose of the even was to discuss the issue and solutions to helping girls in Afghanistan get an education under the Taliban rule.

OVS and CISOA are committed to providing quality education to girls in Afghanistan and helping them to prepare for bright and successful futures.

## OVS Sponsorship in Kenya

At Ontario Virtual School, we are dedicated to our goal of giving all students access to an excellent education, no matter where they are located in the world.

We recently had the honour of working with a former Canadian rugby team member who attended a school in Kenya before immigrating to Canada. His previous school has no electricity, or internet, making an online education not possible for these students.

However, OVS was able to help sponsor these kids by providing a backpack filled with school supplies to each student. Now, they can attend school with quality materials to help aid them on their educational journey.
