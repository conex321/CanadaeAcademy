### Final Exams

All OVS courses have mandatory final summatives. For many of our courses, this final summative takes the form of an exam. To maintain academic integrity, all final exams must be written in-person under the supervision of an approved proctor. In keeping with our self-paced model, the date and time of the final exam are decided by the student, but the proctor must be approved by the OVS instructor. **Who can act as a proctor?** A proctor is a professional adult of the student’s choosing, who is not related to the student (e.g. day school teacher, guidance counselor, librarian, doctor, lawyer, accountant, etc.) who has a dedicated professional email address (i.e. [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)) This individual must agree to supervise the student for the duration of the exam, in accordance with OVS procedures, as outlined by the instructor. The exam may be written at a time, place, and location that is most comfortable for the student. Proctors must have access to a printer and scanner, and must not be related to the student. **How are exams scheduled?** Students enter their proctor’s details, including their professional email address and phone number, into the “Exam” tab of their course at least 3 days in advance of when they would like to write the exam. This request will first be agreed to by the listed proctor; once they have confirmed their willingness to proctor, their information will be forwarded to the teacher for approval. Once approved, the student and proctor can mutually determine the desired date, time, and location of the exam. The student will then enter the date and time into the “Exam” tab and our system will automatically email a copy of the exam and policy form to the proctor 2 hours prior to the scheduled time. The approved proctor and student may then proceed with the final exam as scheduled. Once the final exam has been written, the proctor must send the exam back to the teacher as a scanned, clearly legible document. If a student chooses a proctor who charges a fee for their services, OVS is not responsible for that fee.
