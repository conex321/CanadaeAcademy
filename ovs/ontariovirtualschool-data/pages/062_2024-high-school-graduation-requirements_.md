Over the past few years, many changes have been made to the Ontario high school curriculum. For example, several Grade 9 courses have now been de-streamed, in an effort not to pigeon hole students too early into a particular academic stream. Currently [English (ENL1W)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/enl1w/), [Math (MTH1W)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mth1w/), [Science (SNC1W)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/snc1w/) and [Geography (CGC1W)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/cgc1w/) have all been de-streamed, and are no longer divided into Academic or Applied. This allows students the time they need to build skills and work with the material, before making a selection into an academic or applied stream in Grade 10.

This year, there have been some fundamental changes to the graduation requirements for students who are just entering Grade 9. So, while students who entered high school last year will still be working off the original graduation requirements, new students have a different set of criteria they need to meet.

In order to help parents and students navigate these changes, this article breaks down these new and previous requirements.
