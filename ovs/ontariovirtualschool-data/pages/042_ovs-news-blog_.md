The idea of the university is far from new. It dates back to the Middle Ages, when some of the world’s first centres of higher learning took shape in cities like Paris, Bologna, Montpellier, Oxford, and Salamanca. Closer to home, the oldest institution of higher learning in Canada dates back to 1663, with the Université of Laval having been founded by the Séminaire de Québec. Since that time, the desire for higher learning has flourished. Today Canada currently has 97 public universities with over 16,000 university programs to choose from. What is more, 9 Canadian universities are in the top 200 in the world, including 4 in the top 100!

Canada is known around the world for having school systems that support both high achievement and fair opportunities for students. We also take pride in being a multicultural country, where diversity is valued and protected. Across Canada, education is shaped by important national laws and policies, such as the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, as well as decisions related to child care, language rights, immigration, and Indigenous peoples.

January 12, 2026

On a recent trip to Ottawa, the capital city of Canada, I was reminded how incredible it is to be a Canadian citizen and how proud I am of the role that Canada plays on the global stage. As I was visiting various tourist attractions and significant sites around the city, I couldn’t help but reflect on all of the connections to the content of various online high school courses offered at Ontario Virtual School and their relevance to shaping students’ sense of identity, both nationally and internationally.

December 29, 2025

At some point or another, we’ve all had the experience of misinterpreting the tone of an email or text message. Whether it is due to lack of punctuation, a questionable word choice, poor organisation or confusing sentence structure, it can sometimes be challenging to communicate effectively through email. This is why “netiquette” is an important component of teaching and learning at Ontario Virtual School and is part of online high school success.

Pretending that in class high school, circa 2019 was a panacea that we must return to if we are to restore “the perfect” mental health of students, is simply not true for millions of students globally. The “one size fits all” model benefits some students, but has historically been detrimental to others.
