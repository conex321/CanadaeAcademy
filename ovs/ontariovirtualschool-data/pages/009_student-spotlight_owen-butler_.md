Owen Butler is a student athlete who balanced hockey training alongside his high school courses. He graduated from OVS in May 2025 and will be attending [University of Waterloo – Business Administration (Laurier) and Mathematics (Waterloo) Double Degree (Co-op only) this fall.](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/business-administration-mathematics-double-degree)

We asked Owen a few questions about his time with OVS.

## What courses did you take with OVS?

Calculus [(MCV4U)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mcv4u/), Advanced Functions [(MHF4U)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mhf4u/), Data Management [(MDM4U)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mdm4u/), Computer Science ([ICS3U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/ics3u/) and [ICS4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/ics4u/)), English ([ENG4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4u/)), Physics ([SPH4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sph4u/)).

## How has OVS prepared you for life outside of high school?

OVS has taught me time management skills that are transferable to every day life. They have also taught me self-discipline given it is an online institution and I work at my own pace. I had to be disciplined in making sure I managed my time accordingly to balance a busy schedule and graduate on time.

## What were your most memorable parts of learning with OVS?

* The quality lessons, including the videos and narration
* The timely teacher responses to emails
* The timely feedback/marks to tests and assignments
* Overall student support from teachers and administration
* Ease of use of the LMS (accessing the lessons, the tests, the teaching resources etc)
* Ease of the registration process

## How did your experience with OVS compare to your day school experience?

My experience with OVS was completely different from day school because I am a fast learner and so I was able to progress through class much quicker than I would have been able to in day school.

## What advice would you share with students who may be looking to take courses outside of their day schools?

I would tell them to enroll with OVS and to have a plan. Scheduling out your classes and putting aside time to work will help a ton and keep you on track. That way you have a bench mark on if you’re ahead or not.
