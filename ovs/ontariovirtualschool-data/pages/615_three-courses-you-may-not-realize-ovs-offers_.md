[Since beginning operations more than a decade ago](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/about-us/), Ontario Virtual School has continued to add new courses each year. As of this writing, OVS proudly offers [more than 120 different courses](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/)! Like with all OVS course offerings, these credits follow the Ontario Ministry of Education curriculum, earning students who complete them approved credits that count towards their [Ontario Secondary School Diploma](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ossd-requirements/).

Yet, with so many options to choose from, it can be hard to decide which electives to take! In fact, OVS offers more courses than traditional day schools are even able to (given physical limitations and minimum enrollment requirements). In this blog, we highlight three courses you might not realize are available with OVS.
