As we head into this holiday season, it is important to reflect on the past, while also making plans for the year ahead.

OVS has had another record year this year, reaching more student than ever before. We are very proud of everything we’ve accomplished and are looking forward to continue our growth.

It is also incredibly important to make sure our students are prepared for the remainder of the school year, especially our senior students, and ensuring that they are aware of college and university deadlines.

## OVS Year in Review

![2024 Year in Review](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024-Year-in-Review.png)

## Important OUAC Collection Period Dates

![OUAC Deadlines 2024-2025 (1)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/OUAC-Deadlines-20242025-1.png)

During the 2024-2025 application cycle, OUAC has set dates during which most Ontario schools will submit available grades. These periods are referred to as ‘Collection Periods’. This year, there are four significant collection periods for any available grades.

Most collection periods are designed for specific midterm or final marks for semester 1 and 2.

As a reminder, OVS is not a semester-based institution. We have the ability to submit your grades any time, including outside of collection periods. Though most schools only submit during the designated windows, any current enrolments, midterms, or final marks can be submitted at your request.

Please note that universities do not expect all final grades to be in until the final collection period, in June/July. If you miss an earlier collection period, your grade can be submitted during a following collection period or between periods. Please note, however, that **the final collection period for current grade 12 students closes on July 7th** and all grades should be submitted by that time.

## **Collection Period 2**

This collection period is for all in progress and final grades from the first semester:

* + - **Opening Date:** January 20th 2025
    - **Closing Date:** February 13th 2025
    - OVS Deadline for submitting work: Thursday February 6th 2025

## **Collection Period 3**

* + - **Opening Date:** March 17th 2025
    - **Closing Date:** April 24th 2025
    - OVS Deadline for submitting work: Thursday April 17th 2025

## **Collection Period 4**

* + - **Opening Date:** June 2nd 2025
    - **Closing Date:** July 7th 2025
    - OVS GROUP 1 Students deadline for submitting work: June 5th 2025
    - OVS GROUP 2 Students deadline for submitting work: June 25th 2025

Ontario Virtual School Deadlines for submitting work for marking are non-negotiable. Dates are set 1 week prior to OUAC deadlines to allow teachers adequate time to mark submitted work. Please note that teachers have many students following the same deadline. We will not ask teachers to mark faster than the 1-2 business day turnaround time. **We cannot guarantee that work handed in after the OVS deadline** (highlighted in red) will be marked in time for grades to be sent during collection periods. It is imperative that you follow these deadlines if you want grades submitted to OUAC during the collection period.

## OVS OUAC Groups

![](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025-World-Junior-Ice-Hockey-Championship.png)

At OVS, we have many student athletes who use are program to achieve their high school education while training diligently in their sport. Given that ice hockey is one of Canada’s official national sports, it’s not surprising that several of our student athletes are training and competing at an elite level in this sport.

These year OVS student athlete Ethan Gauthier, will be competing in the [2025 World Junior Ice Hockey Championship](https://www.hockeycanada.ca/en-ca/team-canada/men/junior/2024-25/selection-camp/roster-sel-camp). He will be playing in the right-wing forward position on this year’s team. The competition will begin on December 26th 2024, and will end with the gold medal game being played on January 5th 2025.

We wish Ethan the best of luck and will be cheering him on!

## New Graduation Requirements

This year, there have been some fundamental changes to the graduation requirements for students who are just entering Grade 9.
