As an educator with [Ontario Virtual School (OVS)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), I recognize the importance of teaching students how to effectively balance their nutritional goals while completing online OSSD credits. In [HFA4U, Nutrition and Health](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/hfa4u/), once students learn about the significance of nutrition during adolescence and its pivotal role in long-term health, they are eager to follow nutritional guidelines highlighted in [Canada’s Food Guide](https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/). However, the main barrier I encounter is a lack of time. Here are a few strategies to stay on track without compromising your nutrition and health!

## Key Strategies for Balancing Nutrition and Academics

### 1. Meal Planning

* Use a calendar to plan out your meals for the week (this is also cost-effective, as you will find yourself only purchasing the required items)
* Dedicate a few hours every weekend to cook in batches and store pre-portioned meals
* Refer to the [Food Guide](https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/), to ensure each meal includes healthy carbs, protein, fruits and vegetables

### 2. Healthy Snacks

* Prepare healthy snacks in advance, so you don’t find yourself reaching for highly processed sugary snacks
* Examples: Hummus and baby carrots, greek yogurt parfait, protein banana bread, apple slices with nut butter, trail mix, whole grain crackers and cheese

### 3. Scheduled Meal Breaks

* Set a reminder for meal and snack breaks to maintain energy levels and focus for your online courses throughout the day
* Plan meals before or after online classes to avoid missing meals *(Completing high school credits online provides students with the flexibility to build their daily schedules according to their needs)*

### 4. Hydration

* Keep a bottle of water in close proximity (Aim for a larger bottle, i.e. 32 oz)
* Infuse your water with natural flavouring of your choice (i.e. lemon, lime, mint, berries)

### 5. Mindful Eating

* Try to eat your meals away from the screen and with others
* Eat slowly and be aware of fullness cues

Balancing nutrition and academics doesn’t have to be a chore! Having a nutrient rich diet can actually positively impact one’s academic success, as it can help students improve their energy, clarity, and memory-retention. Check out this article by [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/maximize-memory-function-with-a-nutrient-rich-diet). By following the time-saving tips above, students can take small steps to improving their long-term health while also building healthy habits. I challenge you to eat healthy in a timely and cost effective way, all while completing your high school courses online!
