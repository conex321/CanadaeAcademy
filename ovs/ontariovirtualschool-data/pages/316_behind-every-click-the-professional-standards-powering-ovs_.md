**Source:** https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/behind-every-click-the-professional-standards-powering-ovs
**Description:** When it comes to education, Ontario offers students access to world-class teaching and learning. This claim is supported by two sources of comparative performance data: PCAP- the Pan-Canadian Assessment Program, which tests random samples of Grade 8 students in each province; and PISA - the OECD’s Programme of International Student Assessment, which tests random samples of 15-year-old students from around the world. According to this data, Ontario has maintained its strong international standing in math, reading and science and positions Ontario among the top provinces in Canada.

When it comes to education, Ontario offers students access to world-class teaching and learning. This claim is supported by two sources of comparative performance data: PCAP- the [Pan-Canadian Assessment Program](https://www.cmec.ca/240/Pan-Canadian_Assessment_Program_(PCAP).html), which tests random samples of Grade 8 students in each province; and PISA – the OECD’s [Programme of International Student Assessment](https://www.oecd.org/en/about/programmes/pisa.html), which tests random samples of 15-year-old students from around the world. According to this data, Ontario has [maintained its strong international standing](https://news.ontario.ca/en/statement/1003935/ontario-maintains-strong-international-standing-in-math-reading-and-science) in math, reading and science and [positions Ontario](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/commentary/pisa-results-a-breakdown-by-province) among the top provinces in Canada.

## Highly Qualified Teachers at OVS

One of the reasons why Ontario fares so well on the international stage is because of the high standards of practice set by the Ontario College of Teachers. Ontario Virtual School recognizes the value of these high standards and requires that all teachers at OVS must be OCT certified. This means that all students enrolled in any OVS online course, such as online Gr. 12 English ([ENG4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4u/)) or Gr. 12 Chemistry ([SCH4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sch4u/)), are taught by highly qualified educators.

## Standards of Practice Embodied by OVS Teachers

In addition to providing guidance regarding the knowledge and skills necessary to teach in Ontario, the [Standards of Practice for the Teaching Profession](https://www.oct.ca/public/professional-standards/standards-of-practice) define the values and beliefs associated with the teaching profession as well as articulate the goals and aspirations of the profession. As an online private high school in Ontario, students can expect these standards to be embedded in any of our Ontario Virtual School [online courses](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/) in a variety of ways:

###### 1. Commitment to Students and Student Learning

Whether a student is working towards their online [OSSD](https://www.ontario.ca/page/earning-your-high-school-diploma) credits or taking an [upgrade course](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/upgrade-courses/) to demonstrate higher understanding of course content, OVS teachers are committed to helping students achieve their goals.

###### 2. Professional Knowledge

Since all teachers at Ontario Virtual School are accredited by the Ontario College of Teachers, [teachers at OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/meet-our-staff/) are well-versed in current learning theories, teaching practices, student development, curriculum, and educational research to inform their teaching.

###### 3. Professional Practice

The [flexible learning model](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/about-us/) at OVS, which includes self-paced asynchronous learning and the submission of draft assignments before evaluation,  allows teachers to use appropriate teaching practices, assessment and evaluation, resources and technology in planning for and responding to the needs of individual students and learning communities.

###### 4. Leadership in Learning Communities

Ontario Virtual School recognizes that successful teaching and learning is a shared responsibility that requires collaboration in order to facilitate student success. This is why in addition to dedicated OCT teachers, students have access to a variety of supports such as [Guidance and Student Success](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/guidance-student-success/), [IEP Accommodations](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/iep-accommodations/), and [Mental Health Resources](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/mental-health/).  planning for and responding to the needs of individual students and learning communities.

###### 5. Ongoing Professional Learning

The teachers at OVS recognize that professional practice and self-directed learning are informed by research, collaboration, experience, and knowledge. This is why many teachers at OVS are continually looking for ways to improve their practice by taking additional qualifications, pursuing higher learning and engaging in professional development with the ultimate goal of improving [student and parent satisfaction.](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/recommendations-students-parents/)
