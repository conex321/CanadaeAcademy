## Applying with OUAC/OCAS

Looking towards the future means thinking about your post-secondary education. If you are applying to university this year there are some important dates you should remember. Our deadline for requesting midterm marks is April 15th. Other important upcoming OUAC updates can be found [here.](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ouac-info-updates/)

###### Remember, in order for us to add any marks or enrollment to your OUAC profile, you need to add “Ontario Virtual School” as an alternate school in the “Academic Information” section of your OUAC account. [This blog](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/understanding-the-2021-ouac-application/) will show you how! If you are looking to apply to college you can find information about applying through OCAS [here](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ocas-info-updates/).

## Mental Health Awareness

Coming out of the dark winter months it’s important to check on your mental health. We have a new podcast that discusses how virtual learning can be beneficial for some students’ mental health. In the podcast we talk about issues with bullying, microaggressions, racism, and general anxiety that students can face and how online learning can help negate some of these issues. You can check out our [podcast](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/podcast-ep-1-how-online-learning-can-help-mental-health/).
