In Ontario, Grade 12 students can choose from many different courses. Though there are many different Grade 12 Science courses, such as [SPH4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sph4u/) (Grade 12 Physics), <SBI4U> (Grade 12 Biology), and [SCH4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sch4u/) (Grade 12 Chemistry), students aren’t actually required to take any Grade 12 Science courses to earn their [Ontario Secondary School Diploma](https://www.ontario.ca/page/earning-your-high-school-diploma). Likewise, though there are multiple Grade 12 Math courses, like [MHF4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mhf4u/) (Grade 12 Advanced Functions) and [MCV4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mcv4u/) (Grade 12 Calculus and Vectors), students can earn their diplomas without taking any Grade 12 Math courses, if they so wish. The same goes for all other Grade 12 subjects. Graduating students are required to take a number of Grade 12 courses, but they don’t have to take courses from any particular subject… with one exception.

There is one compulsory subject that students are required to take before graduation, English. However they do still have a degree of choice in this subject, as there are multiple Grade 12 English courses. Here at [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), we offer two different Grade 12 English courses, [ENG4C](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4c/) and [ENG4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4u/). It’s understandable that some students and families may be unclear in the difference between the two courses, but this difference is very important, as it can impact a student’s options after graduation. That’s why we’ve made this quick overview of these two courses, to help students make the comparison: ENG4U vs ENG4C.

## Overview of ENG4C: Grade 12 College Preparation English

ENG4C is a course designed to prepare students for college or the workplace. To quote the Ministry of Education’s official [ENG4C curriculum guide](https://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/secondary/english1112currb.pdf#page=110), “An important focus will be on using language with precision and clarity and developing greater control in writing.”

## Overview of ENG4U: Grade 12 University Preparation English

The ENG4U course is designed to prepare students for university, college, or the workplace. To quote the [ENG4U curriculum guide](https://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/secondary/english1112currb.pdf#page=92), “An important focus will be on using academic language coherently and confidently, (and) selecting the reading strategies best suited to particular texts and particular purposes for reading.”

## Pros of ENG4C:

* Allows students to earn their OSSD.
* Allows students to apply to college.
* Less challenging than ENG4U.

## Cons of ENG4C:

* Does not allow students to enroll at Ontario universities.

## Pros of ENG4U

* Allows students to earn their OSSD.
* Allows students to apply to both college and university.

## Cons of ENG4U:

* More challenging than ENG4C.

## When to choose each

In the end, the course you should take depends on what you want to do after high school. If you want to go to university, then you will need to take ENG4U. However, if you plan to go to college, or straight into the workplace, then ENG4C will allow you to earn your diploma and reach those goals more easily.
