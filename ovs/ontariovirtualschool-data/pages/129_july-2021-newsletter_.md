## Student Spotlight: Juanita Rangel Galvis earns vital credit for UofT acceptance through OVS from her home in Colombia!

Meet Juanita! A grade 12 student from Colombia with dreams of attending the University of Toronto. The only problem? She was missing a Chemistry credit in her Grade 12 year at the time of application. Thankfully, she was able to enroll and complete this vital course through OVS – without even leaving her home in Colombia!

> I have been accepted and I am planning on going to the University of Toronto to study Mechanical Engineering. Although I haven’t started classes, I do feel confident in the knowledge I have gained thanks to the SCH4U course I took at OVS.
