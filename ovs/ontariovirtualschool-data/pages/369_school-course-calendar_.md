## A.School

### 1.1 and 1.3 School Goal and Philosophy

The vision of Ontario Virtual School is to empower all learners, through the use of technology to experience scholastic success. We strive to promote students to achieve their highest academic potential at a pace and timing that best supports their personal learning style. Research has demonstrated the tremendous importance and value of completing secondary education, not only for the individual but also for the community and other stakeholders. OVS is committed to working with students, and parents to enable all learners to accomplish their goals towards completing an Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD).

### 1.2 Our Commitment

Each teenager has his or her own unique interests, goals and strengths. Yet, every student should have the same opportunity to succeed and graduate from high school. Bill 52, The Education Amendment Act, Learning to Age 18, 2006, mandates that teenagers must remain in school until the age of 18 however, every student learns in his or her own way. This is where Ontario Virtual School can play a significant role in the lives of many. OVS values the importance of successfully completing a secondary education and offers students an alternative means of achieving that.

### 1.4 School Organization

Ontario Virtual School operates on a continuous entry and exit model where there is no defined start date or end date. It is therefore the students’ responsibility to communicate their anticipated endpoint to the teacher and then adhere to that timeline (within reason). OVS is proud to announce that we support student learning 12 months of the year. As such we do not have pre-defined reporting dates. Upon completion of half the course, students will be provided with a Provincial midterm report card, and upon completion of the course the student (day school and/or post-secondary institutions and/or application centers if applicable) will receive a copy of the final report card.

### 1.5-1 Rights and Responsibilities of Students, Parents & Staff

***Cheating and Plagiarism***
“Learning is enhanced when students think independently and honestly”. It is expected that students will demonstrate respect for the intellectual property rights of others and adhere to a code of honor in all course activities. Students must understand that the tests/exams they complete and the assignments they submit for evaluation must be their own work and that cheating and plagiarism will not be condoned.

***Plagiarism is defined by OVS as***
The use of ideas or thoughts of a person other than the writer, without proper acknowledgement;

The use of direct quotations, or of material paraphrased and/or summarized by the writer;

The submission of an assignment that has been written in part or in whole by someone else as one’s own; and

The submission of material that has been obtained from a computerized source, with or without minor modifications, as one’s own.

***Cheating is defined by OVS as***
The buying and/or selling of assignments, or exam/test questions;

Submission of the same piece of work in more than one course without the permission of the teacher;

The preparation of an assignment by someone else other than the stated writer;
Allowing one’s assignment to be copied by someone else;

Providing another student your assignment;

The unauthorized giving or receiving of information or assistance during an examination or a test.

Academic dishonesty destroys the integrity of the program by diminishing the learning experience for the entire Ontario Virtual School community. Therefore, maintaining academic integrity is imperative. Whether intentional or through the ignorance of the policy, acts of academic dishonesty are unacceptable and will not be tolerated. These acts and the parties involved will receive a mark of zero for the assignment. In addition, all students involved will be subject to additional consequences which will be addressed on a case-by-case basis. These consequences will reflect a continuum of behavioral and academic responses and consequences, based on at least the following four factors:

1. The grade level of the student,
2. The maturity of the student,
3. The number and frequency of incidents, and
4. The individual circumstances of the student.

***Appropriate Computer Use Policy***
Learning Management System (LMS) at the Ontario Virtual School is designed for educational purposes only. All use of any LMS tool within course for any purpose other than the intended educational purpose is prohibited. The inappropriate uses include, but are not limited to, criminal, obscene, commercial, or illegal purposes.

The administration has the right to review all student work in order to determine the appropriateness of computer use. If the LMS is deemed to be used inappropriately, the Administration will levy consequences which may include suspensions and/or removal from the program. In some cases, further action may be taken including contacting day schools, legal representation or the police.

Students need to be very vigilant in order to prevent them getting into a situation where they may be suspected for inappropriate use.

Therefore, students are reminded to

* Always protect their passwords and not share them with anyone
* Always inform their teachers of suspicious messages or other incidents that they encounter
* Always only access content that is intended for student use.

### 1.5-2 Student Achievement

The Assessment and Evaluation Policy for Ontario Virtual School is consistent with Ministry policy and reflects the vision that Ontario Virtual School has which is that the primary purpose of assessment is to improve student learning. Assessment is the process of gathering information that accurately reflects how well a student is achieving the curriculum expectations in a subject or course. Assessment for the purpose of improving student learning is seen as both “assessment for learning” and “assessment as learning”. As part of assessment for learning, teachers provide students with descriptive feedback and coaching for improvement. Teachers engage in assessment as learning by helping all students develop their capacity to be independent, autonomous learners who are able to set individual goals, monitor their own progress, determine next steps, and reflect on their thinking and learning. Ongoing per-assessments and formative assessments will be used to provide meaningful feedback about student progress and achievement in order to improve performance. Summative assessments will be used to arrive at the grade.

### Course evaluation will be divided into two parts:

70% is based on cumulative evidence of summative evaluations undertaken throughout the semester; -30% is based on final evaluations which will take place in the final third of the course. Final evaluations may or may not include an exam depending on individual course curriculum policy documents. At the beginning of the course, students will receive course outlines that will include detailed assessment and evaluation information, and that also outline the percentage breakdown for both the 70% and the 30%. All courses will be evaluated according to the following breakdown:

Term work: 70% [based on Knowledge and Understanding, thinking and Investigation, Communication and Application]

Final Summatives 30% [based on Knowledge and Understanding, thinking and Investigation, Communication and Application]

Although each course will have the same breakdown, individual courses may have subject specific summative tasks that will be used to determine the student’s grade. Please refer to the course outline as it is presented in your courses for more details.

### Second Chance Protocol

Based on the premise that the primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning, students will be given additional opportunities to demonstrate their learning if they are not successful on their first attempt. It will be at the teacher’s discretion and professional opinion on when to exercise this option.

### Repetition of a Course

* Only one credit is earned if course is repeated
* In Grade 11 and 12, an “R” appears on the student’s OST for the course with the lower mark

### Requesting Course Changing

Course transfer policy: A student who registers and is enrolled into a course for less than a week and does not complete an assessment in the course, may request to be transferred to another course. Students will only be granted one course transfer per enrollment. All course transfer requests must come within one week of the initial enrollment. The decision of the OVS Principal will be considered final in all cases involving student requests for course transfers.

### Reporting Student Achievement

Ontario Virtual School will use the Provincial Report Card, Grades 9-12, for formal written reports sent home two times over the duration the student is active in the course. The first report reflects student achievement of the overall curriculum expectations during the first reporting period, as well as development of the learning skills and work habits. The final report reflects achievement of the overall expectations for the entire course, as well as development of the learning skills and work habits.

### Learning Skills

The following Learning Skills guideline will be used by online teachers when assessing students Learning Skills:

| Learning Skills and Habits | Sample Behaviors |
| --- | --- |
| **Responsibility** | **The Student**  * Fulfill responsibilities and commitments within the learning environment; * Completes and submits class work, homework, and assignments according to the agreed-upon timelines; * Take responsibilities for and manages own behavior. |
| **Organization** | **The Student**  * Devises and follows a plan and process for completing work and tasks; * Establishes priorities and manages time to complete tasks and achieve goals; * Identifies, gathers, evaluates, and uses information, technology, and resources to complete tasks. |
| **Independent Work** | **The Student**  * Independently monitors, assess, and revises plans to complete tasks and meet goals; * Uses class time appropriately to complete tasks; * Follows instructions with minimal supervision |
| **Collaboration** | **The Student**  * Accepts various roles and an equitable share of work in a group; * Responds positively to the ideas, opinions, values, and traditions of others; * Builds healthy peer-to-peer relationship through personal and media-assisted interactions; * Works with others to resolve conflicts and build consensus to achieve group goals; * Share information, resources, and expertise and promotes critical thinking to solve problems and make decisions |
| **Initiate** | **The Student**  * Looks for and acts on new ideas and opportunities for learning; * Demonstrates the capacity for innovation and a willingness to take risks; * Demonstrates curiosity and interest in learning; * Approaches new tasks with a positive attitude; * Recognizes and advocates appropriately for the rights of self and others. |
| **Self-Regulation** | **The Student**  * Set own individual goals and monitors progress towards achieving them; * Seek clarification or assistance when needed; * Assesses and reflects critically on own strengths, need, and interests; * Identifies learning opportunities, choices, and strategies to meet personal needs and achieve goals; * Perseveres and makes an effort when responding to challenges. |

### 1.5-3 Attendance

Regular attendance is key to student success. Students who do not attend/log on regularly and/or who do not actively participate in their courses seriously jeopardize their opportunities to learn and reach their potential.

Teachers will monitor attendance patterns for their respective students and will work with them, and their parents/guardians to support students in any way they can. If student attendance issues cannot be resolved, the administration will be informed and possible consequences may include: student and parental/guardian contact, attendance contracts, or even removal from the program.

Attendance for record keeping purposes will be based on the number of completed lessons. For example, if a course has 20 different lessons to complete and the student has completed 16 of these, the attendance register would indicate that the student was in attendance 80% of the 110 hours per credit course. This value will be scaled accordingly for the mid-semester report card.

Students who do not complete their courses within 12 months will be removed from the course and will not be reinstated unless there are extenuating circumstances that can be verified by appropriate documentation

### 1.6 School’s Code of Conduct

Ontario Virtual School will attempt to provide and maintain a safe and supportive educational environment in which learning can occur. Protection of a person’s dignity and self-esteem is crucial and not negotiable.

All members of the Ontario Virtual School community, which includes students, staff and parents, will treat each other with respect in all interactions. Any actions determined to jeopardize the moral tone of the learning community including disrespectful, distasteful, abusive, harassing comments made to any of our community members will not be tolerated and will be dealt with swiftly by the OVS Principal. Consequences may include, counseling, parental involvement, suspension, expulsions and/ or the involvement of the authorities.

Students are responsible for fulfilling this requirement on their own time. [Click here](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/OVS/FAQ/CompletionofCommunityInvolvementActivitiesFORM.doc) for the form to record community service hours. Please contact the Principal of Ontario Virtual School if you have any further questions regarding community involvement as a prerequisite for the OSSD. If a student is unsure whether their intended community activity will satisfy the requirements, students and parents are requested to forward the notification of planned community involvement activity to the Principal prior to commencing. [Click here](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/OVS/FAQ/NotificationofPlannedCommunityInvolvementFORM.doc) for the notification of planned community involvement form.

### 2.5 Prerequisites, Exemptions, Substitutions and Alternative Studies

Prerequisites for Grade 11 and 12 courses are specified in the curriculum policy documents for the various disciplines. These can be viewed on the Ministry of Education website: In most cases, students will only be registered into a course once they have submitted documentation supporting their completion of the prerequisite course. For example, the prerequisite for the Grade 11 university preparation course in Math is the Grade 10 academic course in Math. A student who has completed a course of one type in a particular subject and grade that does not meet a stated prerequisite for a course in the same subject in the next grade but has completed a transfer course is equally eligible to take the requested course providing once again that supporting documentation is forwarded to OVS. In unique situations, mature students that do not have the prerequisite can apply for an exemption. This must be requested in writing to the Principal of Ontario Virtual School. The requesting student will have an opportunity to explain their circumstances. An example of such a case would be a student who has been out of any school system for more than one year. If you wish to apply for such consideration please send an email to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) outlining the following information as well as forwarding your most recent transcript by email:

* **Name:**
* **Contact information: Address, phone and email address**
* **Date of Birth:**
* **Last school attended and Year attended:**
* **Reason for Request:**
* **Special Circumstances:**

Ontario Virtual School will not make substitutions for compulsory or optional courses; students are expected to complete all compulsory and optional courses as outlined in the Ministry of Educations OSSD graduation requirements.

Please download and complete the form below to be considered for prerequisite exemptions.

[Prerequisite Exemption Form](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/OVS/FAQ/WaivingofprerequisiteFORM.doc)

Students can earn credits outside of OVS including ILC, distance education, public or private schools. Students must inform us confirming their enrollment as well as having that institutions forward us directly a record of completion.

### 2.6 Reach Ahead

Under certain conditions, elementary students may “reach ahead” to take secondary school courses. The principal of a student’s elementary school and the principal of a secondary school may decide, with parental consent, that it is appropriate for the student to enroll in one or more secondary courses. In such a case, the principal assumes responsibility for evaluating the student’s achievement and for granting and recording credits. (Ontario Schools, S. 2.5.2.1)

Elementary students who are eligible to “reach ahead” must also include the following with their registration:

* Reach Ahead Enrollment Request – Form located below
* Letter of recommendation from student’s current school principal
* Most recent school report card

<https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/reach-ahead-elementary-students/>

## C.Curriculum

### 3.1 The Ontario Secondary School Certificate

The Ontario Secondary School Certificate will be granted on request to students who leave school before earning the Ontario Secondary School Diploma, provided that they have earned a minimum of 14 credits distributed as follows:

***Compulsory credits (total of 7)***

* 2 credits in English
* 1 credit in Canadian geography or
* Canadian history
* 1 credit in mathematics
* 1 credit in science

***Optional credits (total of 7)***
7 credits selected by the student from available courses. The provisions for making substitutions for compulsory credits (described in section 3.2: Substitutions for Compulsory Courses) also apply to the Ontario Secondary School Certificate. Ontario Virtual School currently does not offer the Ontario Secondary School certificate.

### 3.2 The Certificate of Accomplishment

Students who leave school before fulfilling the requirements for the Ontario Secondary School Diploma or the Ontario Secondary School Certificate may be granted a Certificate of Accomplishment. The Certificate of Accomplishment may be a useful means of recognizing achievement for students who plan to take certain vocational programs or other kinds of further training, or who plan to find employment after leaving school. The Certificate of Accomplishment will be accompanied by the student’s Ontario Student Transcript. For those students who have an IEP, a copy of the IEP may be included.

Students who return to school to complete additional credit and non-credit courses will have their transcript updated accordingly, but will not be issued a new Certificate of Accomplishment. The Ontario Secondary School Diploma or Ontario Secondary School Certificate will be granted when a student has fulfilled the appropriate requirements.

### 3.3 Credit definition

A credit is granted in recognition of the successful completion of a course which has been developed from an Ontario Ministry of Education guideline, and for which a minimum of 110 hours of instructional time has been scheduled. The credit is granted by the Principal of a school offering secondary school programs on behalf of the Ontario Ministry of Education.

### 3.4 Definition of Types of Courses

Students in **Grades 9 & 10** will take their core courses (English, Mathematics, Science, French, Geography and History) in one of three levels – **applied, academic.** All elective courses will be taken at the **open** level.

**Academic Level: “D”**

Academic courses focus on the essential concepts of the discipline plus additional related concepts. Academic courses develop students’ knowledge and skills by emphasizing theoretical, abstract applications of the essential concepts while incorporating practical applications, as appropriate.

**Applied Level: “P”**

Applied courses focus on the essential concepts of the discipline. Applied courses develop students’ knowledge and skills by emphasizing practical, concrete applications of the essential concepts while incorporating theoretical applications, as appropriate.

**Locally Developed Level: “L”**

Locally Developed courses focus on the most essential concepts of a discipline. These courses are offered in Mathematics, Science, English and Canadian History. These courses will provide support for students making the transition to high school by enhancing their skills to allow them to be successful at secondary school.

**Open Courses: “O”**

Open level courses have one set of expectations for each subject and are appropriate for all students. Open level courses are offered for all non-core subjects and do not have a prescribed post-secondary destination.

**Course Level Description for Grade 11 and 12 Courses:**

Courses in grades 11 and 12 are offered in levels that are related to a student’s destination after high school – workplace, apprenticeships, college or university. Some courses are offered at the Open level. Most courses are offered at one other following five levels:

**University/College Courses: “M”**

Courses designed to prepare students for entrance to college and university programs following high school.

**College Courses: “C”**

Courses designed to prepare students for entrance to college programs following high school.

**Workplace Courses: “E”**

Courses designed for students planning to enter the workplace directly following high school.

**Open Courses: “O”**

Courses that are not specific to any particular post secondary destination are appropriate for all students, and which students may take to meet compulsory or optional requirements.

**University Courses: “U”**

Courses designed to prepare students for entrance to university programs following high school.

### 3.5 Course Coding System

The design of the Ontario education system at the secondary level is framed on the concept of students earning credits, both mandatory and optional credits. The course coding of all programs offered through OVS employ a 5-character system that is established and recognized by the Ministry of Education; for example:

M1C2V344U5

The first digit indicates the major area of study for the course; for example, M-mathematics, S-science, E-english the second and third digit serves as the course descriptor within the subject area; CV- calculus and vectors, BI-biology the forth digit signifies the grade level; 1 is grade 9, 2 is grade 10, 3 is grade 11 and 4 is grade 12 The fifth and last digit is used to denote the intensity by which the course will be delivered. In grade 9 & 10 options include D representing academic, P for applied and O for open level courses. In grade 11 & 12, this digit is geared towards the post-secondary destination: U is university, C is for college and M represents courses open to university or college.

At Ontario Virtual School, we offer a variety of D, P, M, C, E, O and U level courses. These courses are sufficient to satisfy both the required and elective components towards the OSSD.

Information on Ministry course documents and Ontario Curriculum Policy documents may be found at the Ministry website, <http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/secondary/>

### 3.9 Experiential Learning

While OVS recognizes the tremendous value of job shadowing and cooperative education as it enables learners to apply their knowledge and skills through hands on experiences; we do not offer co-op based courses at this time.

### 3.10 Withdrawing from a Course

* Withdrawals occurring within 5 days of the issuing of the first report card from the Ontario Virtual School (OVS) will result in the mark not being recorded on the OST.
* a withdrawal from a Grade 11 or 12 course after 5 days of the issuing of the first report card results in a “W” being entered in the “Credit” column of the OST along with the mark at the time of the withdrawal.
* Withdrawals at any time from Grade 9 or 10 courses are not recorded on the OST
* If there are extraordinary circumstances relating to a student’s withdrawal from a course, an “S” may be entered in the “Note” column on the OST.

### 3.11 Changing Course Type

Students do have the opportunity in some cases to change the course type. However, each subject area has specific criteria to permit such changes. To discuss your unique situation, please send an email to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) outlining the following information as well as forwarding your most recent transcript by email:

* **Name:**
* **Contact information: Address, phone and email address**
* **Date of Birth:**
* **Last school attended and Year attended:**
* **Reason for Request:**
* **Special Circumstances:**

### 3.12A Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition (PLAR)

K-12 students may receive a credit without taking a course if they can demonstrate that they have the skills and knowledge from prior learning to meet the expectations for the course set out in the provincial curriculum. This must be requested in writing to the Principal of Ontario Virtual School. The requesting student will have an opportunity to explain their circumstances. If you wish to apply for such consideration please send us an email outlining the following information as well as forwarding your most recent transcript by email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

* **Name:**
* **Contact information: Address, phone and email address**
* **Date of Birth:**
* **Last school attended and Year attended:**
* **Reason for Request:**
* **Special Circumstances:**

The Principal will review the application and schedule an interview to conduct an assessment of the skills necessary for the credit equivalency being requested.

### 3.12B Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition (PLAR) for mature students

Because of the broader life experience of mature students, the requirements concerning the application of PLAR procedures are different for them than for regular day school students.

A mature student is a student who is at least eighteen years of age on or before December 31 of the school year in which he or she registers in an Ontario secondary school program; who was not enrolled as a regular day school student for a period of at least one school year immediately preceding his or her registration in a secondary school program (for mature students, a school year is a period of no less than ten consecutive months immediately preceding the student’s return to school); and who is enrolled in a secondary program for the purpose of obtaining an OSSD.

### 3.13 Other Ways of Earning Credits

There are many different ways that students can earn high school credits outside of Ontario Virtual School. Registration for these courses require approval from the guidance department. These opportunities include; eLearning, ILC, continuing education courses from public school boards.

### 3.14 Examination Policies

The final exam is typically a paper-pen evaluation written at a mutually agreed time, date, and location. The final exam will be proctored, meaning a suitable adult with a dedicated identifiable and authentic email address will supervise you writing the final exam. This process ensures the security and integrity of the exam. Any person related or affiliated to the student in a personal way cannot serve as an exam supervisor.

### 3.15 Ontario Student Record (OSR)

The Ontario Student Record (OSR) is the record of a student’s educational progress through schools in Ontario. The Education Act requires that the principal of a school collect information “for inclusion in a record in respect of each pupil enrolled in the school and to establish, maintain, retain, transfer and dispose of the record”. The act also regulates access to an OSR and states that the OSR is “privileged for the information and use of supervisory officers and the principal and teachers of the school for the improvement of instruction” of the student. Each student and the parent(s) of a student who is not an adult (that is, a student who is under the age of eighteen) must be made aware of the purpose and content of, and have access to, all of the information contained in the OSR.

If a student is enrolled in one or more OVS courses and is also registered either full time or part time in another Ontario secondary school, the OSR will be held by the school where the student is taking the most courses. Please note that OVS is not responsible to hold the OSR for students who have already graduated from another school, the graduating school is obligated to keep those records. If a student has not graduated high school and is exclusively pursuing courses towards their OSSD from Ontario Virtual School, OVS will request, establish and manage the OSR as per the Education Act. Items such as copies of report cards, IEP documentation, community involvement and results of the Ontario Secondary School Literacy test are examples of records kept in an Ontario Student Record.

### 3.16 Ontario Student Transcript (OST)

The Ontario Student Transcript (OST) is an official document issued by all public or private schools in Ontario. The OST contains a list of the courses completed from grades 9 through 12 including those completed successfully or unsuccessfully. The OST is stored in the OSR and kept for many years after the student graduates. Please note, as per the policies outlined in the Ontario Student Transcript Manual 2010 document, the school that maintains the OSR is also responsible for updating and maintaining the OST. Consequently, if a student is enrolled full time or part time through another school, that school will house the OST. Ontario Virtual School is responsible to assist in this record keeping process by notifying the OST holding school of the course and final achievement of a student taking a course through OVS. When students complete a course through OVS, they will be mailed a final report card. In addition, a second copy will be forwarded to the school that secures the students’ OSR so they can add it to the ongoing list of courses on the students overall transcript. Students that need a certified copy of their Ontario Student Transcript are directed to contact the guidance department of the school that holds their OSR. Students that require their final marks to be faxed to the Ontario University Application Centre are requested to send an email to info@ontariovirtualschool clearly authorizing this request including their first and last name, the course and final mark to be submitted, OEN and OUAC reference number.

### 5.1 Program Planning – supporting students at-risk

Ontario Virtual School provides supplementary individual student counseling with respect to course selection and post-secondary planning. By doing so, individual student needs and concerns are met and appropriate plans can be put into place. In addition, the skills and competencies that students acquire through the guidance and career education program outlined in Ontario’s “Creating Pathways to Success: An Education and Career/Life Planning Program for Ontario Schools, 2013” will not only help students succeed in school, but will also contribute to their success in the workplace.

Throughout their secondary school education, students in Ontario Virtual School courses will learn about the educational and career opportunities that are available to them; explore and evaluate a variety of those opportunities; relate what they learn in their courses to potential careers in a variety of fields; and learn to make appropriate educational and career choices.

To this end, OVS:

* The student success team will contact inactive students and parents to re-engage them with their learning
* The student success team will work collaboratively with the student to create a customized study and learning plan to empower the student to reach their academic goals
