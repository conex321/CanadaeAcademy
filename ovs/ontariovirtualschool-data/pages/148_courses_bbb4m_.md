## Assessment & Evaluation

As summarized in [Growing Success 2010](http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/success.html), the primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning. Information gathered through assessment helps teachers to determine students’ strengths and weaknesses and adapt curriculum and instructional approaches accordingly.

As part of assessment, teachers provide students with descriptive feedback to help guide their learning Evaluation refers to the process of measuring the quality of work against an established criteria, and assigning a value representative of work quality. All curriculum expectations must be accounted for in instruction, but evaluation focuses on students’ achievement of the overall expectations.

A students’ achievement is evaluated in relation to specific expectations. Teachers use their professional judgement to determine which specific expectations should be used to evaluate achievement of overall expectations, and which ones will be covered in instruction and assessment but not used as an evaluation benchmark. To ensure assessment and evaluation are valid and fair teachers use assessment and evaluation strategies that:

* Address both what students learn and how well they learn
* Are based on the achievement level descriptions given in the achievement chart
* Are varied in nature, administered over time, and designed to provide opportunities for students to demonstrate the full range of their learning
* Are appropriate for the learning activities used, the purposes of instruction, and the needs and experiences of the students
* Are fair to all students
* Accommodate students with special education needs, consistent with the strategies outlined in their Individual Education Plan
* Accommodate the needs of students who are learning the language of instruction
* Ensure that each student is given clear directions for improvement
* Promote students’ ability to assess their own learning and to set specific goals
* Include student work samples as evidence their achievement
* Are communicated clearly to students and parents at the beginning of the school year and at other appropriate points throughout the school year.

The achievement chart outlines four categories of knowledge and skills:

1. Knowledge and understanding
2. Critical thinking
3. Communication
4. Application

Teachers assess and/or evaluate work in a balanced manner with respect to the four categories. A final grade is recorded, and a credit is granted and recorded for this course if the student’s grade is 50% or higher. The final grade for this course will be determined as follows:

**Seventy percent of the grade** is based on evaluations conducted throughout the course. This portion of the grade reflects the student’s most consistent level of achievement throughout the course, although special consideration should be given to more recent evidence of achievement.

**Thirty percent of the grade** is based on a final evaluation and administered towards the end of the course.

Ontario Virtual school was an amazing experience. They helped me earn a credit and achieve the grade I wanted. The teacher I had for my course (HFA4U) was extremely helpful and made it easy for me to understand the concepts taught in the course as the slideshows were easy to follow. The website was amazing and super easy to navigate through. It even allowed my parents to sign into my account as a "guardian" so they can look at my work and my sure I am on track. The lessons were super easy to follow as the slides shows were interactive and clear making it easy for the viewer to comprehend. There were no hidden fees at any given point during the corosue the expense was the flat fee (purchasing the course.) My work I submitted was always returned very quick and I was provided with feedback to always help me improve for the next assignment. When requesting my midterm and final report card the admin made it super easy as they processed it very quickly and sent it over to my school. Quick and simple!
Overall Ontario Virtual School was an amazing experience as the admin and staff are all professionals and made it easy for me to gain my credit while at the same time teaching me a lot as I left the course (HFA4U) with lots of great knowledge.

I took the MHF4U course at OVS, and the lessons were very descriptive and easy to understand. The tests were a good amount of difficulty, and you are given a more than reasonable amount of time to complete them. My teacher marked all my tests and final exam, in no more than a day, and was super helpful with any questions I had. My midterm and final marks were also uploaded to the OUAC in less than 2 days, and was a super easy process! I strongly recommend this course to anyone who's having a bit of trouble with how fast-paced their math class is at their day school, and wants to learn at their own comfortable speed.

At first I was very hesitant when deciding to join this place because of the fact that it was my first time doing a course completely virtually and independently. But I have to say I was very impressed with the overall layout and user friendly website that OVS had to offer. The course I took was Grade 12 international business(BBB4M) and I found it to be a great course with lots of interesting lessons. The teacher I had was Ms. Lakhani and she was also very quick to respond to emails and always had answers to any questions. Also marks for assigments and tests were always updated within a day or two. Overall, I would definetly reccommend OVS to anyone that is interested.

I recently took ENG 12 with Mr. Ford to upgrade my previous high school mark. It was very challenging but accessible. The lectures were well organized and easy to follow. Mr. Ford was very, very prompt with grading and answering emails. The expectations of the course were realistic and the practice test/exam was something I wish I'd had in high school. Not only were there practice questions but tips on what was expected from each answer. All-in-all a great experience.

My experience taking online courses with OVS was phenomenal! I took grade 12 Advanced Functions MHF4U and my teacher was Mr. Currie. He was extremely quick with responding to any of my questions and marking my tests, discussion posts and lab simulations. The corrections were always sent to me within 24h, even on the weekends! The course lessons were easy to follow and were delivered in an organized fashion. Doing the course at my own pace allowed me to achieve unmatched success. I would highly recommend OVS to any students interested in following the Ontario curriculum who are looking to "reach ahead" in their high school studies.
