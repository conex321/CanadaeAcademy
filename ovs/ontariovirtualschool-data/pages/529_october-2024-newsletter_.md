## OSSLT Updates

![](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/Ontario-Secondary-School-Literacy-Test-Blog-Photo.png)

The [Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test](https://www.eqao.com/the-assessments/osslt/) is a requirement for earning your OSSD. This test is designed to measure whether students are meeting the minimum standard for literacy across all subjects. Generally, this test is administered during the Grade 10 year, but it can be completed at any time during high school.

During COVID, this requirement was waived, as testing was not possible. When the Literacy Requirement for graduation was reinstated, students could take the OLC4O course instead of the test. This option was provided to assist older students who missed the test but were now required to fulfill the literacy requirement.

This year, all students, whether online or in a brick-and-mortar school, are required to take the OSSLT in order to graduate. Ontario Virtual School (OVS) is currently setting up the test for our Grade 12 students graduating this year. OVS will hold two sessions for this test:

1. 1. 1. 1. **Fall session** – November 5 to December 3, 2024
         2. **Spring session** – March 18 to April 15, 2025

Once students have selected a session, they will be asked to pay a $200 fee. This fee covers the testing and includes a teacher-facilitated preparation module with lessons, practice exams from previous years, and more to help students prepare for this mandatory test.

If you have questions regarding the OSSLT requirement, please contact the OVS office at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6706030a0e092708091306150e08110e151312060b14040f08080b490406)
