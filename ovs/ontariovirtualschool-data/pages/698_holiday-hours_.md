The OVS office will be open throughout much of the Winter holidays to better support you as you work through your courses over the Winter break.

We will be closed for Christmas Day and New Year’s Day, and will be closing at 4pm on Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve.

All other days will be regular hours: open from 8am-8pm.

Please note, these are office hours only. Individual teachers will be updating their course homepages with any expected delays in their holiday marking schedule.
