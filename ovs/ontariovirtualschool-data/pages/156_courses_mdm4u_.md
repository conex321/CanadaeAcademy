## Fundamental Concepts Covered in Grade 12 Mathematics Online Course

This course broadens students’ understanding of mathematics as it relates to managing data. Students will apply methods for organizing and analysing large amounts of information; solve problems involving probability and statistics; and carry out a culminating investigation that integrates statistical concepts and skills. Students will also refine their use of the mathematical processes necessary for success in senior mathematics. Students planning to enter university programs in business, the social sciences, and the humanities will find this course of particular interest.

## Online Teaching and Learning Strategies

The mathematical processes are to be integrated into student learning in all areas of this course.
Throughout this course, students will:

* **Problem Solving** – develop, select, apply, compare, and adapt a variety of problem-solving strategies as they pose and solve problems and conduct investigations, to help deepen their mathematical understanding
* **Reasoning and Proving** – develop and apply reasoning skills (e.g., use of inductive reasoning, deductive
  reasoning, and counter-examples; construction of proofs) to make mathematical
  conjectures, assess conjectures, and justify conclusions, and plan and construct
  organized mathematical arguments;
* **Reflecting** – demonstrate that they are reflecting on and monitoring their thinking to help clarify their understanding as they complete an investigation or solve a problem (e.g., by assessing the effectiveness of strategies and processes used, by proposing alternative approaches, by judging the reasonableness of results, by verifying solutions)
* **Selecting Tools and Computational Strategies** – select and use a variety of concrete, visual, and electronic learning tools and appropriate computational strategies to investigate mathematical ideas and to solve problems
* **Connecting** – make connections among mathematical concepts and procedures, and relate mathematical ideas to situations or phenomena drawn from other contexts (e.g., other curriculum areas, daily life, current events, art and culture, sports)
* **Representing** – create a variety of representations of mathematical ideas (e.g., numeric, geometric, algebraic, graphical, pictorial representations; onscreen dynamic representations), connect and compare them, and select and apply the appropriate representations to solve problems
* **Communicating** – communicate mathematical thinking orally, visually, and in writing, using precise mathematical vocabulary and a variety of appropriate representations, and observing mathematical conventions

## Assessment & Evaluation

As summarized in [Growing Success 2010](http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/success.html), the primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning. Information gathered through assessment helps teachers to determine students’ strengths and weaknesses and adapt curriculum and instructional approaches accordingly.

As part of assessment, teachers provide students with descriptive feedback to help guide their learning Evaluation refers to the process of measuring the quality of work against an established criteria, and assigning a value representative of work quality. All curriculum expectations must be accounted for in instruction, but evaluation focuses on students’ achievement of the overall expectations.

A students’ achievement is evaluated in relation to specific expectations. Teachers use their professional judgement to determine which specific expectations should be used to evaluate achievement of overall expectations, and which ones will be covered in instruction and assessment but not used as an evaluation benchmark. To ensure assessment and evaluation are valid and fair teachers use assessment and evaluation strategies that:

* Address both what students learn and how well they learn
* Are based on the achievement level descriptions given in the achievement chart
* Are varied in nature, administered over time, and designed to provide opportunities for students to demonstrate the full range of their learning
* Are appropriate for the learning activities used, the purposes of instruction, and the needs and experiences of the students
* Are fair to all students
* Accommodate students with special education needs, consistent with the strategies outlined in their Individual Education Plan
* Accommodate the needs of students who are learning the language of instruction
* Ensure that each student is given clear directions for improvement
* Promote students’ ability to assess their own learning and to set specific goals
* Include student work samples as evidence their achievement
* Are communicated clearly to students and parents at the beginning of the school year and at other appropriate points throughout the school year.

The achievement chart outlines four categories of knowledge and skills:

1. Knowledge and understanding
2. Critical thinking
3. Communication
4. Application

Teachers assess and/or evaluate work in a balanced manner with respect to the four categories. A final grade is recorded, and a credit is granted and recorded for this course if the student’s grade is 50% or higher. The final grade for this course will be determined as follows:

**Seventy percent of the grade** is based on evaluations conducted throughout the course. This portion of the grade reflects the student’s most consistent level of achievement throughout the course, although special consideration should be given to more recent evidence of achievement.

**Thirty percent of the grade** is based on a final evaluation and administered towards the end of the course.

## Special Accommodations for Students with an IEP

Every single student is capable of success. Some students are able, with certain [accommodations](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/iep-accommodations/), to participate in the regular course curriculum and demonstrate independent learning.

[Accommodations](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/iep-accommodations/) allow access to the course without any changes to the [knowledge and skills the student is expected to demonstrate](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/assessment-evaluation/). The accommodations required to facilitate the student’s learning are identified by the teacher. Recommendations from a School Board generated [Individual Education Plan (IEP)](https://www.specialeducationguide.com/pre-k-12/individualized-education-programs-iep/the-iep-process-explained/) if available can also be consulted. Instruction based on principles of universal design and differentiated make it possible to meet the diverse needs of all learners.

**Examples of accommodations (but not limited to) include:**

* Adjusting or extending assessment deadlines
* Providing alternative assignments or summative tasks
* Use of scribes and/or other assistive technologies
* Simplifying the language of instruction

I took the MAP4C class and was able to complete my prerequisite course for my other academic adventures. My teacher Mr. Luu was very responsive with not only his feedback on tests and emails, but also with grading.
I highly recommend this course to anyone looking to upgrade or complete their math. Ontario Virtual School is a very simple website to navigate and I was happy to have found this online school.

I have taken two courses at Ontario Virtual School, Data Management (MDM4U) and Economics (CIA4U). Both my teachers were very nice and helpful. They were always available and responded to my emails quickly. All my work was handed back fast and I had no trouble getting my marks submitted to OUAC. The lessons are easy to follow and the assignment instructions are very clear. It is a great online school and I had a fantastic experience.

I needed to complete MDM4U in order to get accepted into a university program I was apply to. Math is not a subject that I am comfortable with and now I was faced with needing to get the credit if I wanted to get accepted into the program I was interested in. I enrolled and had a small window to get it completed by. I spoke with professor and explained my situation and he was so helpful and turned around the marking so my grades were posted quickly. I was able to share with the university and offered admissions to the program. The course was easy to follow and so convenient to work at your pace. The professor answered all my questions in a timely manner and the admin staff was so great at getting my mid-term and final grade to the university. I'm actually looking at enrolling in a History course at the school as it is an exit requirement for my degree. Thank you so much for helping me to achieve my goals.

My experience with OVS was very wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and experienced learning from a wonderful teacher that helped me when I needed it most. My grade 12 math course was well structured and I ended up learning the material well.
This org is very good for students picking up credits outside of a typical school. Deadlines are mostly your own with a teacher to help you when you need it.

I had taken MDM4U at Ontario Virtual School, and it was an amazing experience. The virtual school offers a wide range of courses available towards the students. The school is extremely excellent with providing a great amount of lessons and course material for each one of its students. The unit tests and exams had variety of assessments such as multiple choice, word problems, etc. The highlight of my experience with Ontario Virtual School is that I was able to start right away after registering and was able to work at my own pace. In addition to this, the teachers were extremely helpful and are very quick with handing back tests and answering back to any questions. I highly recommend Ontario Virtual School to anyone that is considering taking a course virtually.
