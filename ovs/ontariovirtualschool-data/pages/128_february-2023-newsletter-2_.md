## Adding OVS to OUAC

If you’re a part-time student with OVS and you need us to send records to OUAC directly, you’ll need to add OVS to your OUAC account.

* + **Start date: the month you started with OVS this year.**
  + **End date: 2024 06**
  + **Degree type: OSSD**

## New OVS Courses

Students in Ontario now have options when it comes to achieving their Grade 11 English credit. They can take the standard [ENG3U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng3u/) or [ENG3C](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng3c/) course or they can take the newer [NBE3U Grade 11 English: Understanding Contemporary First Nations, Metis, and Inuit Voices.](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/nbe3u-copy/)

This course explores the themes, forms, and stylistic elements of a variety of literary, informational, graphic, oral, cultural, and media text forms emerging from First Nations, Métis, and Inuit cultures in Canada, and also examines the perspectives and influence of texts that relate to those cultures.

FRA6G: Grade 6 Core French

We are currently working to expand our selection of Grade 6-8 courses available for students.

[Grade 6 Core French](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/fra6g/) provides students with the opportunity to use their previous knowledge and apply new vocabulary and writing conventions to explore topics related to the social studies curriculum by exploring topics in French Canadian history. As beginning language learners, they will learn new vocabulary that will help them describe physical appearances, personalities, describe sports and hobbies, use formal and informal writing conventions, explore various French-speaking cultural traditions, identify environmental issues, just to name a few.

## Upgrade/Repeat Courses

![](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2.-Upgrade-Courses.jpg)

At OVS, we want to see students successfully complete courses and be able to pursue their post-secondary goals. Sometimes, you don’t always get the mark you were hoping for the first time you take a course, and if it’s a requirement you need for a post-secondary program, it can feel like your goals might be out of reach.

However, with OVS you can repeat a course and complete it in as little as 3 weeks, which means there is still time to improve your grade before offers for university or college admission are released.

With an [Upgrade course](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/upgrade-courses/), you are not required to watch all the lessons, only as many as you need to refresh the material. This allows you to focus on problem areas or subjects you might struggle with, while not having to repeat other lessons that you have a solid grasp on.

Depending on the course you’re upgrading, some assignments will become optional, which allows you to submit less work to earn your final grades. However, if students need the extra boost in their marks, you can complete some optional work to try and enhance your grade.

With our Upgrade courses, it’s absolutely still possible to get the course completed and submitted to OUAC or OCAS so your post-secondary program can see it.
