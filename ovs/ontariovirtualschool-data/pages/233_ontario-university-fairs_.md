[**The OUF**](https://www.ouevents.ca/ouf/) takes place from September 27th to 28th 2025, at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre (MTCC) in the South Building.

The fair runs from 9:30am to 5pm both days and offers free admission.

This is a great opportunity for current high school students to talk with representatives from different universities and to really start thinking about where they might want to apply to for post-secondary.

Regional Fairs are similar to the OUF in that they allow students to connect directly with different university representatives to discuss their post-secondary plans and have their questions answered about what program might be right for them.

Regional Fairs take place in different cities ad local high school, university, and other community venues.

Another way high school students can gain valuable information about university programs is through online information sessions that don’t require any travel.

One of these sessions will be taking place November 10th between 5-7pm ET.
