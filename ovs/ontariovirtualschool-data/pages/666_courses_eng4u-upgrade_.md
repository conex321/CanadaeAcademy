## Fundamental Concepts Covered in Upgrade Courses English Online Course

The expectations in the compulsory online course of the course curriculum are organized in four strands, or broad areas of learning: Oral Communication, Reading and Literature Studies, Writing, and Media Studies. Students learn best when they are encouraged to consciously monitor their thinking as they learn, and each strand includes expectations that call for such reflection. The knowledge and skills described in the expectations in the four strands of the language curriculum will enable students to understand, respond to, create, and appreciate a full range of literary, informational, and media texts. The areas of learning are closely interrelated, and the knowledge and skills described in the four strands are interdependent and complementary. Teachers plan activities that blend expectations from the four strands in order to provide students with the kinds of experiences that promote meaningful learning and that help them recognize how literacy skills in the four areas reinforce and strengthen one another.

## Online Teaching and Learning Strategies

Teachers will bring enthusiasm and varied teaching and assessment approaches to the classroom, addressing individual students’ needs and ensuring sound learning opportunities for every student. The activities offered should enable students to relate and apply these concepts to the social, environmental, and economical conditions and concerns of the world in which they live. Opportunities to relate knowledge and skills to these wider contexts will motivate students to learn in a meaningful way and to become life-long learners. The English curriculum is based on the premise that all students can be successful language learners. One of the keys to student success in mastering language skills is high-quality instruction. Teachers who provide quality instruction respect students’ strengths and address their learning needs, using assessment information to plan instruction. They clarify the purpose for learning, help students activate prior knowledge, and differentiate instruction for individual students and small groups according to need. Teachers explicitly teach and model learning strategies and encourage students to talk through their thinking and learning processes. They also provide many opportunities for students to practice and apply their developing knowledge and skills. Effective teaching approaches involve students in the use of higher-level thinking skills and encourage them to look beyond the literal meaning of texts and to think about fairness, equity, social justice, and citizenship in a global society.

## Assessment & Evaluation

As summarized in [Growing Success 2010](http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/success.html), the primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning. Information gathered through assessment helps teachers to determine students’ strengths and weaknesses and adapt curriculum and instructional approaches accordingly.

As part of assessment, teachers provide students with descriptive feedback to help guide their learning Evaluation refers to the process of measuring the quality of work against an established criteria, and assigning a value representative of work quality. All curriculum expectations must be accounted for in instruction, but evaluation focuses on students’ achievement of the overall expectations.

A students’ achievement is evaluated in relation to specific expectations. Teachers use their professional judgement to determine which specific expectations should be used to evaluate achievement of overall expectations, and which ones will be covered in instruction and assessment but not used as an evaluation benchmark. To ensure assessment and evaluation are valid and fair teachers use assessment and evaluation strategies that:

* Address both what students learn and how well they learn
* Are based on the achievement level descriptions given in the achievement chart
* Are varied in nature, administered over time, and designed to provide opportunities for students to demonstrate the full range of their learning
* Are appropriate for the learning activities used, the purposes of instruction, and the needs and experiences of the students
* Are fair to all students
* Accommodate students with special education needs, consistent with the strategies outlined in their Individual Education Plan
* Accommodate the needs of students who are learning the language of instruction
* Ensure that each student is given clear directions for improvement
* Promote students’ ability to assess their own learning and to set specific goals
* Include student work samples as evidence their achievement
* Are communicated clearly to students and parents at the beginning of the school year and at other appropriate points throughout the school year.

The achievement chart outlines four categories of knowledge and skills:

1. Knowledge and understanding
2. Critical thinking
3. Communication
4. Application

Teachers assess and/or evaluate work in a balanced manner with respect to the four categories. A final grade is recorded, and a credit is granted and recorded for this course if the student’s grade is 50% or higher. The final grade for this course will be determined as follows:

**Seventy percent of the grade** is based on evaluations conducted throughout the course. This portion of the grade reflects the student’s most consistent level of achievement throughout the course, although special consideration should be given to more recent evidence of achievement.

**Thirty percent of the grade** is based on a final evaluation and administered towards the end of the course.

## Special Accommodations for Students with an IEP

Every single student is capable of success. Some students are able, with certain [accommodations](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/iep-accommodations/), to participate in the regular course curriculum and demonstrate independent learning.

[Accommodations](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/iep-accommodations/) allow access to the course without any changes to the [knowledge and skills the student is expected to demonstrate](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/assessment-evaluation/). The accommodations required to facilitate the student’s learning are identified by the teacher. Recommendations from a School Board generated [Individual Education Plan (IEP)](https://www.specialeducationguide.com/pre-k-12/individualized-education-programs-iep/the-iep-process-explained/) if available can also be consulted. Instruction based on principles of universal design and differentiated make it possible to meet the diverse needs of all learners.

**Examples of accommodations (but not limited to) include:**

* Adjusting or extending assessment deadlines

I had an amazing experience with Ontario Virtual High School. I was able to go at my own pace and understand the content very easily. Everything about OVS is well planned, layed out and easily accessible. I recently took ENG4U and I got a great mark. My teacher Mr. Ford was excellent. He answered all my questions within a good amount of time as-well as marked my work very quick. Mr. Ford is also a fair marker and you’ll be able to improve your mark throughout the course.

Ontario Virtual School was extremely helpful and had always replied quickly to my questions. Sir Lewis Scott, my tutor, has been exceptionally good to me and guided me very well throughtout the course. I had taken ENG4U in order to be eligible for my desired universities but along with that, I was able to gain great confidence over my language skills. Mr Scott was always ready to help and I am thankful for that.
I'd highly recommend Ontario Virtual School and Sir Lewis Scott to anybody who needs to add this course for admissions to a Canadian university.
