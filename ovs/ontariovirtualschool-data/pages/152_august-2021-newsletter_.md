## Student Spotlight: Clara Adamian Earns Final Credit for UofT Admission from the UK!

Meet Sadeka! A grade 12 student from the UK with dreams of attending the University of Toronto. The only problem? She was missing a Biology credit in her Grade 12 year at the time of application. Thankfully, she was able to enroll and complete this vital course through OVS – without even leaving her home across the pond!

> I am studying Psychology and Criminology at the University of Toronto, and I’m absolutely loving it! The biology course at OVS made it possible for me to get into Psychology, and made the program much easier to understand, so THANK YOU OVS!
