# Our Picks: Top 10 Grade 12 Elective Credits

It’s a question we receive often from Grade 12 students looking to round out their ‘top six’ for [university applications](https://www.ontariouniversitiesinfo.ca/): “What elective would you recommend?”. Well, we’ve got your answer! Here is our list of the top 10 electives you can take at OVS to earn that all-important last credit.

###### Important!

Please note that the following course options are electives only. While we have designed this list with only 4U and 4M-level credits, which would satisfy minimum admission requirements for any post-secondary pathway, **course selections for Grade 12 should be made based on specific post-secondary program requirements first.**  If you have questions about this, please speak with your guidance counsellor or admissions officer before registering.

### So, without further ado, here are our top picks (in alpha order)!
