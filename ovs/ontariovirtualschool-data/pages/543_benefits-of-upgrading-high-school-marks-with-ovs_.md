Academic upgrading is not a new concept in the field of education to high school or mature students. In fact, statistics obtained from the Ministry of Education’s [website](http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/students/faqs.html) point to an upward trend of thousands of students returning for extra semesters for that sole purpose. Students may complete upgrade courses to improve their marks for various reasons, including the following: University or college admissions. Attaining a certain overall grade average. Achieving personal goals. Meeting Ontario Scholar or scholarship requirements. As it stands, it is possible to upgrade marks of completed courses and even do so using various [easy to use platforms](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ovs-blog/online-schooling-makes-sense/) such as the one provided by [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/).

    The first major benefit when upgrading your marks is that the possibility of achieving a higher percentage can make you more competitive than others applying to the same program. Due to higher numbers of College and University applications, students are finding it more and more difficult to gain acceptance from the institutions of their choice. Upgrading your marks gives you that competitive edge and reduces your chances of being denied.

    Upgrading your mark in [High school courses](/courses/) does not only mean your percentages change. The reality is that revisiting the courses, even if they are taught by different teachers or registering for them at different schools, will allow you to enter University with a stronger foundation in the course content or field of study. In so doing, your University experience and the much greater expectations of being an undergraduate student can be met with relative ease.

       One of the greatest [benefits of repeating a course with Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ovs-blog/what-makes-ontario-virtual-the-right-choice-for-high-school-students/) is that students can work at their own pace. They can complete a course in as little as four weeks or take as long as a year. This self pace program allows students to use their time wisely and be successful. All in all, Universities treat all courses the same as long as they are approved by the Ministry of Education. In addition, Admissions departments state categorically that they are guided by the best attempts at completing the course and second attempts are not considerations for declining a student’s application.

The following is a list of the most popular courses students upgrade in high school.

[Grade 12 Advanced Functions: MHF4U](/courses/mhf4u/)
[Grade 12 Calculus: MCV4U](/courses/mcv4u/)
[Grade 12 Data Management: MDM4U](/courses/mdm4u/)
