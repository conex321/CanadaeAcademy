## Nurturing Life Long Learners Around the Globe

At [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), a self-paced, accredited online high school, we believe that learning is a lifelong endeavor. That’s why we offer [over 170 Ontario curriculum-aligned courses](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/) [accessible from anywhere](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/international-students/) and at any stage of life! Learning isn’t just about earning grades or completing credits – it’s also about developing essential life skills that often go unnoticed by students.

Learning is a life long endeavor and skills you learn in school can be applied to future careers!

Whether you’ve been working toward your Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD), upgrading marks, or fast-tracking your high school courses, your educational journey with [OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/) is shaping you in more ways than you know! So how can you tell if you’re truly growing as a learner? Let’s explore five subtle but meaningful signs that say  “Yes, I’m learning!”

##### 1. You’re starting to embrace feedback (not fear it)

Remember when receiving feedback felt like criticism? That’s totally normal. But now, something’s changed. You’re not just correcting mistakes- you’re asking deeper questions and using Razzetti’s (2023) [five R’s to feedback (request, receive, reflect, respond, and resolve](https://think.fearlessculture.design/p/the-five-rs-of-feedback-a-blueprint)). The process isn’t instinctive -it’s a skill that develops over time (Pacheo, 2019), and at [OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), we help you build it every day.

At [OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), our platform makes feedback easy to access and reflect on. Our instructors are not just here to grade you, but to guide you as well. As Levitt (n.d) explains, “[The key to learning is feedback. It is nearly impossible to learn anything without it](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1214269-the-key-to-learning-is-feedback-it-is-nearly-impossible)”. So, if you’ve noticed yourself embracing and reflecting on feedback, you are growing as a learner!

##### 2. You recognize your strengths and identify your next steps

When students begin Grade 9, their learning path is more structured to ensure they meet the foundational OSSD requirements. However, as they move into Grades 11 and 12, they have greater freedom to select courses aligned with their interests, goals and strengths.

Maybe you’ve discovered that courses like [Families in Canada (HHS4U)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/hhs4u/) inspire you more than [Environment Resource Management (CGR4M)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/cgr4m/). Or maybe you’ve started recognizing patterns in your learning: the subjects that excite you, the rewarding assignments, the career paths that suddenly feel possible. This is self-awareness, and it is a big win! This is a clear sign that you are not just passing courses but becoming a strategic and reflective learner.

##### 3. You take initiative

Taking initiative is not just to improve your grades- it reflects that you’re growing as a learner. It shows that you’re developing the motivation, confidence, and independence needed to thrive in areas outside the school environment. At [OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), our self-paced courses allow students to practice initiative every day by setting their own schedule.

Are you looking to upgrade your high school marks online? Are you starting to think about looking into completing high school faster? These are signs of initiative. Just as students shift from “learning to read” to “reading to learn” in elementary school, [OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/) supports your transition from “learning to take initiative” to “taking initiative to learn”. That’s the essence of lifelong learning.

##### 4. Time management is starting to feel… manageable

We get it – balancing school, work and life isn’t easy. But here’s the thing: you’re doing it! Time management is a skill- and like any skill, it improves with practice (York University, n.d). At [OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), our flexible format helps students develop this skill. Maybe you are prioritizing tasks better, or maybe you’ve been using a planner. Whatever the system is, the point is- it’s working. You’re setting goals and hitting deadlines. This is not just “time management” you’ve learned, but rather “life management”! This highlights how you’re growing into a responsible, capable and independent learner.

##### 5. You can apply your knowledge to real life scenarios

Gone are the days of asking “when am I ever going to use this”! If you are starting to recognize how course content and skills connect to real-life situations, that’s a sign that you are growing as a learner! A key part of this growth is developing cross-curricular thinking – integrating knowledge and skills across subjects. For example, if you are taking [Grade 11 Biology (SBI3U)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sbi3u/) and [Grade 11 Chemistry (SCH3U)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sch3u/), and start thinking about how chemical interactions explain biological processes, you’re transferring knowledge to new contexts. At OVS, we support this growth through projects and activities designed to help students apply what they’ve learned to real-world scenarios

## Final Thoughts: You’re Growing - Even if You Don’t Always See It

Growth doesn’t always come with a neon sign. Sometimes it’s quiet. It’s how you respond to challenges, reflect or navigate your schedule. If any of these signs resonated with you, you’re growing as a learner – and we’re proud to be part of that journey.

So go ahead and take a moment to reflect on and celebrate your progress! We are here for you as you continue to notice these little changes! Check out our [admissions page](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/virtualhighschool-9-12/) to continue your journey as a lifelong learner with us! Don’t forget to look at our [online high school student experiences](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/virtualhighschool-9-12/) to celebrate their learning as well!
