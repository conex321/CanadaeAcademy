Summer may still be a few months away, but it’s time to start deciding how your kids will be spending their time off. For some, this may be summer camp, weekends at the lake, part-time jobs, or taking a few virtual courses.

It’s common for people to think of summer school as a time for students to catch up or retake courses they didn’t do well in. However, summer school can also be used as a time for students to get ahead in their studies.

While students should definitely take some time in the summer to relax and rejuvenate, throwing in a course or two can be extremely beneficial. Doing these courses virtually will make it even easier to balance a relaxing summer while attending school. Here are a few ways that taking high school courses online in the summer can help students get ahead.

#### Get Tough Courses Out of the Way

Virtual courses are generally structured a bit differently than traditional, in-person classes. At OVS, our courses are asynchronous, meaning students don’t have to be online at a set time each week and can access the material whenever they have time. There are also no strict deadlines for assignments. This model gives students a lot more time to work on their courses and ensure they are really understanding the material so they can excel.

Due to the way that virtual courses are structured, taking difficult courses online in the summer is a great option for high school students. This way, they can spend their time working through the material and get the best mark possible. For example, students studying at an [online school](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/) in Ontario could take a difficult high-level course in the summer, such as Advanced Functions.

#### Try Out Different Courses

High school is a great time to try out a variety of different subjects and extracurriculars to find what it is you’re most passionate about. During the regular school year however, students may not have the time in their schedules to fit in different courses that [cater to their passions](https://raisinghealthyteens.org/rht_blog/tips-to-help-your-teen-cultivate-their-passion/). Taking these courses in the summer can help students get a better understanding of what they want to do upon graduation while still completing all their required courses throughout the regular school year.

#### Lessen the Workload Throughout the School Year

Most high school students will have upwards of six courses to attend each day. This [can be extremely overwhelming for some students](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/school-help-teens.html) and can make it difficult for them to do well. By taking a course or two online in the summer, students can decrease the number of credits they need to complete during the school year. This can give them more time to complete their work for each course and get the best grade they possibly can. Having to take fewer courses during the regular school year can also free up some time for them to explore their passions outside of the classroom.
