Ontario Virtual School is kicking off the rest of Season 3 this month on *A Brighter Future, Powered by OVS,* with a series of episodes about adapting to the changing public school system, the Ontario cellphone crackdown, and the new apprenticeship pathways for senior high school students. Before we jump into what’s to come, let’s talk about how we started!

## How A Brighter Future, Powered by OVS First Hit the Air

Ontario Virtual School wanted a place for our teachers to share learning strategies and tools for students. We wanted a bank of episodes that students could review at any time and gain some quick tips to improve their education experience. All the OVS podcast episodes are still relevant today. Each episode covers different learning strategies, education tools to improve academic success, and spotlight interviews with different educators, universities and colleges, parents, and students. These episodes are within 20 to 60 minutes in length and offer handy tips for improving your learning.

## Season 1: Learn about how you Learn!

When the school first started the podcast, they asked teacher and course developer, Ms. Alicia Cuzner, and education and learning technology expert, Dwayne Matthews, to take the mic! Alicia and Dwayne focused Season 1 on how the mind functions, and how we learn. They wanted students and parents to understand how learning works within the brain, and how we can optimize learning by understanding how the mind works

## Season 2: The Education System and University Admission

Season 2 focused on how the Ontario education system works and tips on how students and parents should navigate it. Each episode also included a Secondary School Spotlight, where Alicia interviewed a different Canadian college or university (or an institution that is both) in each episode. Alicia asked questions that students would want to know to University of Ottawa, Trent University, Seneca College, Algonquin College, Western University, University of Toronto, and others!

[Episode 1: What is an IEP?](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/podcast-s2-ep-1-what-is-an-iep/), [Episode 2: Accommodations Vs. Modification](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/podcast-s2-ep-2-accommodations-vs-modification/), and cover all the “buzz words” that often get thrown around in an education setting. These buzz words include learning disabilities, ADHD, Individual Education Plan, accommodation, and modification.

The goal of these episodes is to tackle the stigma around learning disabilities, and why it is important to use any accommodations that are assigned to you in an IEP.

Alicia talks about how to navigate the process of getting assessed for a learning disability with a psychological educational assessment, and how the IEPs are made in Ontario.
