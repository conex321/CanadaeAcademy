Engineering is an ever growing and incredibly popular field of study. Those who enjoy looking at the world around them and trying to figure out the mechanics behind how things work will feel particularly drawn to it. Engineering has several different branches to it, allowing students a wide variety of focused disciplines to choose from.

However, many people think that to be an Engineer, a university degree is required which is something that isn’t easily accessible to everyone. Some people interested in engineering do better with hands on practical courses than they do with theory, so a college program would be a better option to help them reach their career goals.

Which ever branch of engineering appeals to you, there are several college pathways that you can take to help you with your future career.

## Manufacturing Engineering

## OVS and Engineering

The first step to a future career is getting accepted into a college program. No matter the individual type of engineering you might be interested in, there are a few core courses required by most programs.

![](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/course-images/ENG4C.jpg)

[ENG4C: Grade 12 College English](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4c/)

While engineering is predominately about math and science, having the skills needed to effectively communicate ideas and knowledge is just as important.

Grade 12 College English seeks to consolidate the literacy and communication skills, as well as the critical and creative thinking skills, necessary for success in both academic and daily life.

[MCT4C: Grade 12 Mathematics for College Technology](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mct4c/)

This course is either recommended or required by most college engineering programs. It builds on skills learned from grade 11, helping to create a deep foundation of mathematical knowledge that will serve students well in their college programs.

![](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/course-images/MCT4C.jpg)

![](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/course-images/SPH4C.jpg)

[SPH4C: Grade 12 College Physics](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sph4c/)

In order to take this course, students only need have completed Grade 10 science. However, this course is a requirement by most engineering programs, as physics is applied to all types of engineering disciplines.

Students will learn basic concepts in physics, including motion, electricity, magnetism and energy transformation.

## Alternative Math (to MCT4C)

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Ut elit tellus, luctus nec ullamcorper mattis, pulvinar dapibus leo.

![](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/course-images/MAP4C.jpg)

[MAP4C: Grade 12 Foundations for College Mathematics](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/map4c/)

This course won’t be accepted by every engineering program; however, it can be used as an alternative to MCT4C in some cases. This course is a great option if math maybe isn’t your strongest subject but you still have a desire to join an engineering program.

[MCR3U: Grade 11 University Functions](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mcr3u/)

Some college programs will accept Grade 11 University Math in place of a Grade 12 Math course. Taking this in Grade 11, can help free up some time in Grade 12 for other course or other extra-curricular programs.

![MCR3U Grade 11 Functions online course from Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/course-images/MCR3U.jpg)

## Discipline Specific Courses

While English, Math and Physics are required by almost every form of Engineering, different disciplines while have more requirements in other subject areas. Here are a few courses OVS offers that could help you get that college acceptance.

* + - * [SCH4C: Grade 12 College Chemistry](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sch4c/)
      * [ICS3U: Grade 11 Computer Science](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/ics3u/)
      * [ICS4U: Grade 12 Computer Science](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/ics4u/)
      * [SBI3U: Grade 11 Biology](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sbi3u/)

No matter what type of Engineering program you might be interested in, you can get the courses you need to apply to college through OVS, and take one of many college pathways to your future career.
