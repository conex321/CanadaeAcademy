# OVS is proud to announce we have extended our online program to include grades 7 and 8.

Mirroring the quality and support of our high school program, with each course designed and delivered by an OCT-certified teacher. Like all OVS courses, this program is entirely self-paced. And, with pre-recorded multimedia lessons, students can pause and replay as many times as they need!

###### How Can I Use These Courses?

Families can use our program to complement a homeschooling curriculum or to reinforce learning completed through traditional middle schools.
