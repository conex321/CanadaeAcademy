**Description:** Did you know - that according to UNESCO - there are more than 7000 languages spoken around the world today? With this increased diversity in the linguistic landscape, the need for cross-cultural understanding is more important than ever. While learning an additional language is not a new concept, there is now an increased benefit to learning a new language, as it provides the skills needed to build peace, tolerance and respect for differences both within and outside of the classroom.

# **Making the Most of your Education: Choosing Courses That Interest You**

## **Seniors, stop reaching for the “bird courses”**

Remember the first time you got to choose your own courses? There was a lot of talk about choosing between visual arts, drama and music. These early choices can say a lot about a student’s interests, attention to detail and their level of introversion versus extroversion. However, after grade 9, students often [shift their focus on the courses they need for their post-secondary goals](https://www.ontario.ca/page/learn-about-colleges-universities-and-indigenous-institutes-ontario#:~:text=Start%20planning-,Admission%20standards,for%20specific%20information%20about%20admissions.). While this is very important (and necessary), students often overlook courses that they are interested in.

The benefits of taking courses that genuinely interest you can extend beyond high school. So before locking in your course selection with [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), consider the advantages of choosing a course because it excites you! There are [countless virtual high school courses](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/grade-11/) to choose from, [stemming from multiple topics of interest](https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/workpreference)!

## 2. Achieve higher marks

Think about how much easier it is to get up in the morning when you’re about to do something you enjoy. School is the same. When you like the subject, it’s much easier to motivate yourself to do the work. This motivation will naturally lead to a stronger focus, more effort, and often, better grades. The university acceptance from your online high school will naturally come from this!

Intrinsic motivation is motivation that comes from genuine interest or enjoyment,and is an extremely powerful tool that students should be taking advantage of. As a teacher, I often see senior students choosing courses that they deem easy so they can increase their average for university applications. However, they often overlook the power of intrinsic motivation that can be derived from the course content.

This idea connects to the [Self-Determination Theory, which explains that people learn best when they feel autonomous (in control of their choices), competent (capable and confident), and connected (supported by others) (Cherry, 2024)](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-self-determination-theory-2795387). Those who use intrinsic motivation are taking advantage of the Self-Determination Theory. The Self Determination Theory gives people the feeling that they have control over their life and the outcomes.

## 3. Connect with others

* The foundation of many friendships is shared interests. When two people are passionate about the same topic, conversations come naturally (and can go deeper than small talk) and there’s a greater chance you’ll connect again in the future. Shared interests not only spark discussions, but also increase the likelihood of meeting people with similar values and goals through clubs and courses.

  Teachers don’t include discussion forums in courses for nothing! Discussions provide the perfect opportunity to connect with others who share similar interests. By taking a course that genuinely interests you, you’re more likely to meet like-minded peers. These connections can continue beyond the course, especially if you pursue related courses or careers.

## 4. Less stress

Taking control of your course choices as opposed to feeling “forced” to take certain subjects for future goals can significantly reduce stress. By engaging in a topic you are interested in, you’re more likely to stay engaged and motivated, which helps break anxiety loops that may occur while studying. Curiosity about subjects keeps your mind focused and provides a healthy distraction. It’s also easier to enter a calm, focused state when you’re learning about something that naturally interests you.

There is research that supports the connection between interest and stress. Perng et al. (2019) found that [nursing students in Taiwan experienced higher stress levels in their clinical practicum placements when they had lower interest in nursing](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31669965/). In other words, feeling interested and invested in what you study intrinsically can directly protect your mental well-being. Furthermore, taking courses you are interested in may lead to a new hobby, and extracurricular activities for online students have been shown to reduce stress.

## Spark your curiosity

The value of taking courses that interest you extends far beyond a four week to twelve month course. One of the biggest tips for online high school success that educators can give is to enroll in courses that interest you (when you can). Your interests make you unique, and they should be explored. Don’t just take courses to check boxes or because they seem ‘easier’ – choose ones that spark curiosity. [With over 170 courses](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/grade-12/), [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/) has a course just for you. It may be life changing!
