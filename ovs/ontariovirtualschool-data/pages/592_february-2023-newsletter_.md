#### The Hate You Give

![The Hate You Give](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/x450.jpg)

[The Hate You Give](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-hate-u-give-angie-thomas?variant=39715492167714) is [Angie Thomas’s](https://www.harpercollins.com/blogs/authors/angie-thomas-2019573113467) debut novel published in 2017.

The book centres around 16-year-old Starr Carter who is living in two worlds. The suburban preparatory school she attends and the poor neighbourhood she lives in. One night, her world explodes when her childhood best friend Khalil is fatally shot by a police officer. His death becomes national news and everyone wants to know the truth of what happened that night and only one person can say: Starr.

This novel was inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement and inspired a 2018 movie starring Amandla Stenberg, Regina Hall, and Russel Hornsby among others.

## Math Courses

High School Math courses are some of the most versatile and highly requested courses by many post-secondary programs. Whether you plan on going into Business, Engineering, Health or Life Sciences, Computer Sciences and more, Math is going to be a subject that you need to succeed.

At OVS, students can take their time working through their math courses. If it’s a subject you find easy, you can get your required math courses completed and out of the way in as little as 4 weeks. If math isn’t your strong suit, you can take your time to really get a grasp on the material before you have to submit anything for grading. Currently, we offer 3 Grade 12 Math courses at the university level.
