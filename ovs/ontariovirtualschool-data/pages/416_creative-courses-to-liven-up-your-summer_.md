During the school year there is a heavy emphasis put on core subjects like Math, Science, and English. While in some ways this focus benefits many students, it can leave those who are more inclined towards the arts struggling to find time for the courses they enjoy. Not only are they missing out on subjects they like, there are also [studies](https://www.publicschoolreview.com/blog/how-the-arts-benefit-your-children-academically-and-behaviorally#:~:text=The%20study%20by%20the%20National,without%20such%20robust%20arts%20programming.) that show learning arts in high school can not only help students achieve academic success but personal growth as well. OVS can help you get those art credits that may have been left by the wayside.

## Visual Art

These courses cover a wide variety of artistic mediums from digital photography and mixed media, to painting and sculpting. Students will learn to apply various design elements and principles as they expand their creative process.

## Photography

Photography is another form of visual storytelling. Taking photos of the world around us and turning them into complex and meaningful works of art.
