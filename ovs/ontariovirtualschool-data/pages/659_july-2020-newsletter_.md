#### **Teacher Spotlight**

Salut! My name is Mme. Shea and I am going to be teaching **French Immersion** online with OVS!

When I’m not teaching (or under quarantine!), I love to spend time with my kids and travel the world! Lately, I’ve been doing a lot of quilting to pass the time!

Mme. Shea is currently accepting new students for [FIF1D](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/fif1d/), [FIF2D](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/fif2d/) & [FIF3U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/fif3u/).
