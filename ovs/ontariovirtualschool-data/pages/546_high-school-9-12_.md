# Full-Time Students

##### Full-Time Students meet the following three criteria:

* + 1. You intend to complete all remaining requirements and earn your high school diploma (OSSD) through OVS
    2. You are not currently enrolled at an Ontario day school OR you intend to withdraw your enrollment at your current school
    3. You have completed, or will complete, at least 3 credits in a single grade year through OVS

*Note: A student must register for a minimum of 3 credits before OVS will officially begin the transfer process. Students wishing to graduate through OVS without meeting this credit minimum will be required to pay an additional administrative fee.*

*There is a minimum enrollment period that students must meet in order to graduate with OVS. Please contact our office for more details.*

# Full-Time Student FAQs

* [Open all FAQs](javascript:void(0))

  ### What Is The OSSLT? Do I Still Have To Complete This Requirement If I Study Online Through OVS?

  The Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test (OSSLT) is a standardized test that all secondary school students must successfully complete in order to receive their OSSD. This test measures whether or not students are meeting the minimum standard for literacy across all subjects up to the end of Grade 9.

  The test is administered by the Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO) only once each year, meaning all students across the province write this test on the same date, usually a day in late March. Students are expected to take the OSSLT in Grade 10, unless a deferral is granted by the principal. Students who do not successfully complete the OSSLT at this point will have the opportunity to retake the test in subsequent years.

  ### I Am A Grade 8/9 Student Looking To Make OVS My Full-Time School. What Is Required For The OSSD?

  Ontario Virtual School follows the same [OSSD requirements](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ossd-requirements/) as a standard day school, including 30 credits with a mix of compulsory and elective credits, 40 hours of community involvement, and completion of the Literacy requirement. In order for us to officially become your full-time school for Grade 9, you would need to register for at least 4 credits to start and then connect with [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to provide the contact information for your elementary school so we can request your records. We can also help with course selection over email, if you are not sure what to begin with!

  ### I Am A Current OVS Student Taking Multiple Courses. How Do I Know If OVS Already Has My Records?

  Students whose records we house will have access to a special “Guidance” tab within their student portal, where they can track their progress towards the OSSD. Simply put, if you do not see this tab in your left-hand navigation menu, our office has not recognized you as a full-time student. If you would like to become a full-time student at OVS (and you meet the criteria listed above), please connect with our administration as soon as possible.

  ### I’m Not Sure What Courses I Still Need To Take To Graduate, Can OVS Help Me With Course Selection?

  Absolutely! Simply email your most up-to-date transcripts to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and our guidance team will assist you with your course selection prior to registering.

  ### Do I Need To Register For All Courses At Once? Can I Take One At A Time?

  You do not have to register for all credits in a given grade level at the same time. You are free to stagger their enrollment and pacing as meets your schedule and financial situation. With that said, please note that OVS will not officially file the paperwork to become your home school until you have registered for at least 3 credits and emailed our administration to request the transfer of records.

  ### Is The Fee Structure The Same For Full-Time Students?

  Full-time students are eligible to
  ### Do I Need To Register For All Courses At Once? Can I Take One At A Time?

  ### Is An OSSD Earned Through Ontario Virtual School The Same As An OSSD Earned At A Regular Day School?

  Yes, it is. Upon completion of all [OSSD requirements](https://www.ossd-requirements.ca/), we will mail a hard copy of your final transcript and official Ontario Secondary School Diploma to your home address on file. This diploma is issued to us by the Ontario Ministry of Education and is the exact same document as would be issued to you through a traditional day school. Unfortunately, we do not offer formal, in-person graduation services. As an official Ministry-issued document, our OSSD is accepted by post-secondary institutions around the world.

  ### Can OVS Graduate Me?

  Yes. We are fully inspected by the Ontario Ministry of Education and are therefore eligible to issue the OSSD to students who satisfy its requirements through our school. Eligible students must complete a minimum of 6 credits through Ontario Virtual School.

  ### What Does It Mean To Be “Full-Time” With OVS?

  Full-time students are those who take the majority of their credits in a given year through OVS, and whose academic student records our administration maintains. This means that in order to be considered a full-time student with OVS, eligible students must connect with our administration to have their records transferred to our office.
