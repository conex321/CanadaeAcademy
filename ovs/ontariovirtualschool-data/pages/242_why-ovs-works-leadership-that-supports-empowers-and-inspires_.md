Whether at home or at school, in our personal or public lives, we all like to be noticed for our hard work and dedication. This is why it’s important to take note of significant days, such as  [National Principal’s Day](https://www.nationaldaycalendar.com/national-day/school-principals-day-may-1), which was celebrated on May 1 this year.

## What is National Principal’s Day?

As explained by the [Ontario Principal’s Council](https://www.principals.ca/en/opc-resources/national-principals-day.aspx?_mid_=475), this day not only acknowledges the valuable work performed by principals and vice-principals, but it provides an opportunity to recognize their important role in the education system. Whether it’s guiding quality teachers and staff or setting the vision for a school, principals and vice-principals have a direct impact on creating a safe, equitable and productive learning environment for all students.

## Strong Leadership at Ontario Virtual School

Ontario Virtual School is fortunate to have a strong leadership team who work in tandem with other OVS staff to ensure academic success for all OVS students. The principal of Ontario Virtual School is [Mr. Gary Michael](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/meet-our-staff/). As a former high school Math teacher, Department Head of Mathematics, Vice-Principal and Principal in the York Region DSB, Mr. Michael developed a passion for eLearning and applied this area of expertise to set the direction for Ontario Virtual School.

The vice-principal at Ontario Virtual School is [Mr. Patrick Russell](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/meet-our-staff/mr-russell-vice-principal/). As a former high school teacher as well, Mr. Russell has a passion for the arts and believes in the importance of being true to oneself.

## The Importance of Vision at OVS

Both Mr. Michael and Mr. Russell have been able to draw upon their teaching and leadership experience to complement the [vision](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/about-us/) of Ontario Virtual School, which is “to empower all learners, through the use of technology so that they can experience academic success”. In support of this vision, OVS leadership is very proud to be able to offer students online high school [OSSD](https://www.ontario.ca/page/earning-your-high-school-diploma) (Ontario Secondary School Diploma) credits to students in [Ontario](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/virtualhighschool-9-12/), [Canada](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/out-of-province-students/) and [around the world](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/international-students/). At OVS, we believe that every student can be successful and reach their academic potential when they are engaged and active in their learning and they continue to advocate passionately for each student through daily leadership at OVS.

## The Impact of Leadership on Learning at OVS

The [Ontario Leadership Framework](https://www.education-leadership-ontario.ca/application/files/8814/9452/4183/Ontario_Leadership_Framework_OLF.pdf) is a document that outlines effective school leadership practices in Ontario. There is a substantial and growing body of professional knowledge and research that demonstrates that “school leaders are pivotal to the development of excellent teaching, excellent schools and ultimately, enhanced student achievement and well-being”. [The Institute for Education Leadership](https://www.education-leadership-ontario.ca/en) explains how principals and vice-principals are responsible for specific practices, such as Setting Directions, Building Relationships and Developing People, Developing the Organization to Support Desired Practices, Improving the Instructional Program and Securing Accountability. Research has shown that these school-level practices have a positive impact on student achievement and the actions associated with each. This means that [OVS students benefit](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/student-spotlight-alumni/) directly from effective leaders.

## How OVS Supports Students through Leadership

Since school-level practices have such a direct impact on students, both the principal and vice-principal at Ontario Virtual School have made it a priority to ensure that all aspects of Ontario Virtual School reflect these leadership practices.

* + By offering [over 170 courses](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/), such as [ENG4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4u/) or [MHF4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mhf4u/), OVS continues to improve the instructional program for its students.
  + When it comes to developing people, the OVS leadership team has ensured that OVS students have access to [mental health](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/mental-health/) resources to maintain student well-being.
  + The leadership team at OVS also knows the value of securing accountability, which is why there is information available specifically for [Parents/Guardians](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/information-for-parents/) in order to support their child’s education.

 Through these ongoing efforts, amongst others, the leadership at OVS demonstrates a strong commitment to fostering student success, well-being, and accountability across the virtual learning community.

## Conclusion

Because of its strong and intentional leadership, OVS has created a supportive learning environment for those students who cannot attend classes on a regular basis due to personal or health-related reasons, athletic commitments or full-time jobs. Ontario Virtual School has also helped students [upgrade their marks](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/upgrade-courses/) in challenging courses, allowing them the opportunity to improve their understanding and increase their chances of gaining acceptance into competitive post-secondary programs.

If you or someone you know is interested in becoming part of a dynamic learning environment such as this, feel free to contact a [Guidance Counsellor](https://calendly.com/ontariovirtualschool/15min?month=2025-04) for more information or browse from our [selection of online courses](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/) in Ontario to see which one is right for you!
