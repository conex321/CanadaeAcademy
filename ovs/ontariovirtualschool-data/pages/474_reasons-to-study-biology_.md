[Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/) offers a variety of courses, including Grade 11 and Grade 12 Biology. Both grades offer college-level and university-level, in order to meet the needs of a wide variety of students. Biology is a fantastic subject to study, and a wonderful credit to have on your transcript, but what exactly can you do with it? Why should you study biology at OVS?

## About the Courses

Biology is the study of life. Students learn about topics such as genetics, population dynamics, plants and animals, cellular processes, evolution, biochemistry, and more. Students explore the subjects with virtual labs, websites, videos, and research activities.

OVS offers the following biology courses:

* + - * Grade 11 College Biology ([SBI3C](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sbi3c/))
      * Grade 11 University Biology ([SBI3U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sbi3u/))
      * Grade 12 University Biology, French Immersion ([SBI4UF](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sbi4uf/))
      * Grade 12 University Biology ([SBI4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sbi4u/))

While it’s not a requirement to have biology credits to graduate, it can certainly help, especially depending on what you plan to do after high school. Earning online OSSD credits, like Biology 12U, can help get you accepted into a reputable college or university.

## Pathways

Many college and university programs require Grade 12 biology as a prerequisite. One such example is the [Health Sciences degree at Queen’s University](https://bhsc.queensu.ca/), which requires Grade 12 university biology and chemistry. Most programs in medicine, such as nursing, veterinary medicine, kinesiology, pharmacology, and family medicine also require Grade 12 University Biology and  Grade 12 University Chemistry ([SCH4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sch4u/)).

Other programs such as biochemical engineering, environmental and resource science, conservation biology, and programs like [forensic biology at Trent University](https://www.trentu.ca/futurestudents/program/forensic-biology), also require high school biology credits.

## Cross-Curricular Connections

Biology has concepts that connect to other courses, particularly other sciences. Many students in chemistry, physics, and general science, will benefit from studying biology, and vice versa. For example, students who take Grade 12 Biology will complete a unit on biochemistry, which has a lot of overlap with [Grade 12 Chemistry](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sch4u/). Certain aspects of biology also utilize math, English, and even geography, such as with population dynamics. These overlaps mean that studying biology can help deepen your understanding of concepts from other courses as well.
