With spring coming up fast, all of us here at OVS are looking forward to warmer weather and longer days. Along with sunnier skies, we are heading into crunch time for high school seniors applying to post-secondary programs.

OUAC’s next collection period for midterm marks and any final grades available begins on March 13th, and will end on April 27th, 2023. For a full list of OUAC’s collection dates for 2022-2023, please see [OUAC’s Grades Collection Chart](https://guidance.ouac.on.ca/counsellor-resources/grades-collection/).

**IMPORTANT:** In order for us to update OVS enrollment or marks to your OUAC profile, you must first add “Ontario Virtual School” as an additional school within the Academic Background section of your 2022/2023 OUAC Account. Please see [OUAC’s Tutorial #3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jI7w92_EBzQ) between 1:45-2:10 for a step-by-step run-through of this process.

If you have already added OVS to your OUAC account but do not see your current OVS enrollment or marks listed, please contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#58393c3531361837362c392a31372e312a2c2d39342b3b30373734763b39)

## Podcast

![Volunteers for Podcast](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/Volunteers-revised-4-e1678394186737.jpg)

As part of our excellent [Podcast Series](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/podcast-s2-ep-8-how-to-take-notes/), we are looking for 3 student volunteers to talk about their experiences with the following topics: communication skills, adaptive thinking in the digital world, and thinking skills for school.

You will participate in a 15-minute segment where you’ll be speaking with one of our teachers, Alicia Cuzner, about your experiences and what you might tell your past self about the topics listed above.

Whether you’re local or international, if you’re interested in this volunteer opportunity please contact: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#99f8f5f0faf0f8b7faece3f7fcebd9f6f7edf8ebf0f6eff0ebedecf8f5eafaf1f6f6f5b7faf8)

## Upgrading Courses

![Upgrade Courses](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/Upgrade-in-3-weeks-e1678394431390.jpg)

For senior students looking to apply to post secondary school, it can be upsetting to finish a course with a lower grade than what you need or want for your applications. However, with an [online high school](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/) like Ontario Virtual School, there is still time to improve your marks.

Our [Upgrade Program](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/upgrade-courses/) allows students to retake a course and complete it in as little as 3 weeks, which means you can get your mark updated quickly and submitted to [OUAC](https://www.ouac.on.ca/ouac-101/), [OCAS](https://www.ontariocolleges.ca/en) or sent to specific post-secondary institutions.

If you didn’t get the marks you need or if you were declined your acceptance because of a low mark, there is still a chance to turn things around with OVS.

## Course Highlight

![](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/course-images/ENG4U.jpg)

Grade 12 English is a required course to both graduate from high school in Ontario and to apply to post-secondary programs. [Grade 12 University English](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4u/) is the course you’ll need if you plan to attend a university.

Our ENG4U course aims to develop critical and creative thinking skills, as well as essential communication skills needed for both academic and daily life. In this course you’ll learn about the following topics: literary criticism, poetry, essay analysis, and novel studies.

Taking this course with OVS will allow you to work at your own pace, complete it in a time frame that works best for you, and give you the required credit you need for both high school and post-secondary programs.
