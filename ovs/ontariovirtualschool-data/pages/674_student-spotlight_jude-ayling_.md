Balancing the demands of elite athletics with those of academics can be a very difficult task, and [Jude Ayling](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/392648/jude-ayling) knows this better than most. As a promising young hockey player, Jude not only has to dedicate a great deal of time and energy toward his training and practice, but also has to maintain his academic rigor. Added to that, his athletic pursuits involve a great deal of travel, forcing him to choose between academics or athletics. Jude faced this challenge when he began training with [Nordic Hockey Academy](https://www.nordichockeyacademy.com/), a prestigious institution that would help him take his hockey career to the next level. In the meantime, it took him all the way to Norway! ![](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/Norway-274x300.jpg) To ensure that young athletes like Jude can still access high quality education, without interfering with their travel and training schedules, Nordic Hockey Academy has partnered with [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/). We asked Jude about his experience thus far; here’s what he had to say:

###### What courses are you currently taking with OVS?

I am currently taking 6 Grade 12 university-level courses, including [History](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/chy4u/), [Biology](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sbi4u/), [Chemistry](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sch4u/), [Kinesiology](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/psk4u/), [English](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4u/), and [Philosophy](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/hzt4u/).

###### Why did you decide to enroll with OVS?

The ability to build my own school schedule around my intense hockey schedule was something I could not find elsewhere. It was a lot more straightforward (than other schools). The lessons were quick and straight to the point and I could do them at my own pace. ![](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/Hockey-Logo.jpg)

###### What are your favourite parts of learning with OVS?

It teaches you to be independent and self-sufficient. It gives you the opportunity to build your own schedule, especially if you are an athlete or someone with outside commitments. In my case, I could complete the lessons around my training sessions and games. This convenience was amazing.

###### What has your OVS experience taught you so far?

OVS has taught me how to be an independent student and learn to do things on my own with freedom. ![](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/Norway-Flag-300x300.jpg)

###### How did your goals influence your choice of courses with OVS?

I would like to study sports science or sports psychology, so OVS’s guidance team helped me select these courses to prepare me for that path.

###### What are you planning to do after graduating?

I hope to earn a scholarship to play college hockey in the US in the near future.
