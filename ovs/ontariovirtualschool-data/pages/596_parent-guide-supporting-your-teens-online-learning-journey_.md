Online learning through the [Ontario Virtual School (OVS)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), offers students flexibility, independence, and access to high-quality education from anywhere. As a parent, you play a critical role in helping your child succeed in their online courses at Ontario Virtual School (OVS).

This guide outlines practical strategies to keep your teen motivated, organized, and thriving academically.

## 1. Create a Structured Learning Environment

One of the biggest challenges for online learners is separating school time from free time. Help your teen set up a quiet, distraction-free space where they can focus. Encourage them to follow a consistent daily schedule to mimic the structure of in-person schooling.

**Tip:** You can help to ensure their study area is stocked with necessary supplies like notebooks, pens and reliable Wi-Fi.

## 2. Encourage Goal Setting and Time Management

OVS allows students to move at their own pace, and provides flexibility with due dates. Work with your teen to set short-term goals (e.g., finishing two lessons per week) and long-term goals (e.g., completing the course before summer).

**Tip:** Using planners, digital calendars, or apps can help keep assignments and deadlines visible and manageable.

## 3. Stay Engaged

While online learning fosters independence, [parental involvement](https://www.ontario.ca/page/parent-engagement-policy) remains important. Regularly check in with your teen about their progress and challenges. Ask questions like:

●       “What are you learning this week?”

●       “Do you feel confident with your current topic?”

**Tip:** Be supportive, but allow them the space to take ownership of their learning.

## 4. Leverage OVS Resources

Ontario Virtual School provides several [resources](#_7f54culdv4ke), including teacher support, email communication, and feedback on assignments. Encourage your teen to reach out when they need clarification. Remind them that asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.

**Tip:** You can also explore OVS’s wide range of courses, from [Grade 9 HIF1O: Individual and Family Living](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/hif1o/) to [Grade 12 ENG4U: English](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4u/), to see how their interests align with future goals.

## 5. Promote Balance and Well-Being

Academic success goes hand in hand with mental and physical health. Encourage your teen to take breaks, eat nutritious meals, exercise, and maintain social connections. A balanced lifestyle will enhance focus and reduce stress during their online studies.

Tip: Encourage your teen to follow the “[20-20-20” rule](https://www.aoa.org/AOA/Images/Patients/Eye%20Conditions/20-20-20-rule.pdf), for every 20 minutes of screen time, take a 20-second break to look at something 20 feet away. This helps reduce eye strain and boosts focus when they return to their work.

## Conclusion

Supporting your teen’s online learning journey is about finding the balance between structure and independence. By creating the right environment, setting goals, staying engaged, and making use of OVS’s resources, you’ll empower your child to succeed academically while developing lifelong skills in self-discipline and responsibility.

## Q & A:

## Q1: How much time should my teen spend daily on their online courses?

Most OVS students benefit from dedicating 1–2 hours per course, per day. However, since pacing is flexible, this can vary depending on the student’s goals and schedule.

## Q2: What if my child falls behind?

Encourage them to revisit their study schedule and break tasks into smaller, manageable steps. OVS teachers are available for support and can help guide your child back on track.

## Q3: How can I stay informed about my teen’s progress?

Parents can check in regularly with their teen, review assignment feedback, and maintain communication with teachers through OVS’s email support system.

## Q4: Is online learning at OVS recognized by universities and colleges?

Yes, OVS is inspected by the Ontario Ministry of Education and grants OSSD credits that are fully recognized by post-secondary institutions in Canada and abroad.
