This year, the Ontario University Application Centre (OUAC) is changing their application methods. Where previously 101 and 105 students were required to submit different applications, instead everyone will be applying under the OUAC Undergraduate Application.

As part of this process, students no longer require PIN letters to be issued by their school. Instead, students are able to create their own account on the OUAC website without the PIN.

Please watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9MyAdvn0cg&ab_channel=TheOUAC) on creating your OUAC account.
