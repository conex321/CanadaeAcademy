Marketing is more than just advertising, and identifying what the customer wants; marketing encompasses a range of business activities, including purchasing, selling, distribution, customer service, marketing research, and promotion, as well as advertising. In the language of marketing, the term product includes goods, services, and events. The information age, informed consumers, and the global marketplace have changed the tactics and strategies employed by today’s diverse types of business, both for-profit and non-profit. Students will examine how branding, product positioning, and target marketing form part of a business’s dynamic marketing plan. In addition, students will identify the potential for employment in the complex world of marketing.
