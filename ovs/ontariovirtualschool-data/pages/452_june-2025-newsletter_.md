## Scholarship and Bursaries

Scholarships and bursaries are types of financial assistance that do not need to be repaid. Scholarships are typically awarded based on academic merit, while bursaries and grants generally consider financial need.

## Grade 9 Technology Course

![](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/course-images/TAS1O.png)

For students who entered Grade 9 in September of 2024 or later, the graduation requirements have been changed. Students are now required to take a Technology course in Grade 9 or 10 in order to complete their high school diploma.

OVS offers the [TAS1O Grade 9 Technology and the Skilled Trades Online](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/tas1o/). TAS1O invites students to explore the exciting world of technological education through hands-on projects and creative problem-solving. In this course, students will engage with the engineering design cycle, develop foundational skills in a variety of skilled trades, and apply their learning through practical activities in construction, automotive, hospitality and tourism, and communications technology. Students will problem-solve, create, and reflect as they discover how technology shapes our world and their own potential in it.

## Upgrade Courses

![Upgrade Courses](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/Upgrade-in-3-weeks-1024x1024.jpg)

At OVS, we want to see students successfully complete courses and be able to pursue their post-secondary goals. Sometimes, you don’t always get the mark you were hoping for the first time you take a course, and if it’s a requirement you need for a post-secondary program, it can feel like your goals might be out of reach.

However, with OVS you can repeat a course and complete it in as little as 3 weeks, which means there is still time to improve your grade to receive or maintain offers for university applications.

With an [Upgrade course](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/upgrade-courses/), you are not required to watch all the lessons, only as many as you need to refresh the material. This allows you to focus on problem areas or subjects you might struggle with, while not having to repeat other lessons that you have a solid grasp on.

Depending on the course you’re upgrading, some assignments will become optional, which allows you to submit less work to earn your final grades. However, if students need the extra boost in their marks, you can complete some optional work to try and enhance your grade.

With our Upgrade courses, it’s absolutely still possible to get the course completed and submitted to OUAC or OCAS so your post-secondary program can see it.

## Preparing for Grade 9 Math
