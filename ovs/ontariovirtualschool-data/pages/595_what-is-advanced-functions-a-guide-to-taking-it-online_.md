In Ontario, [Advanced Functions (Grade 12)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mhf4u/) is a Grade 12 mathematics course that focuses on, as the name implies, more advanced functions than those studied in the [Grade 11 Functions course (MCR3U).](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mcr3u/)

## What do you do in Advanced Functions?

In Grade 12 Advanced Functions, students broaden their understanding of rates of change. They do this by investigating the properties of polynomial, rational, trigonometric, and logarithmic functions. They then develop techniques for combining and applying these functions in a variety of situations.

## Can I do Calculus without Advanced Functions?

While not a mandatory requirement for earning an [Ontario Secondary School Diploma](https://www.ontario.ca/page/earning-your-high-school-diploma), Advanced Functions is required in order to take the [Calculus and Vectors course (MCV4U).](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mcv4u/) You can take MHF4U either before or at the same time  as completing MCV4U. Calculus and Vectors is itself a prerequisite for many post-secondary programs, especially those in the [STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields](https://www.educanada.ca/start-commencez/stem-stim/index.aspx?lang=eng).

## Why else might students wish to take this course?

Of course, students may also wish to take Advanced Functions without planning to also take Calculus and Vectors. While it is a common misconception that Advanced Functions is only useful to those planning a career in a STEM field, it can also simply help them improve their understanding of mathematics to a level beyond the average Ontario secondary school graduate. The improved mathematics, analysis, and problem-solving skills earned in this course can help people in many areas of life, both in post-secondary education, and outside of school environments.

## Prerequisite courses:

Before starting [Grade 12 Advanced Functions (MHF4U)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mhf4u/), students must have already completed **EITHER**:

[Grade 11 Functions (MCR3U)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mcr3u/)

**OR**

[Grade 12 Mathematics for College Technology (MCT4C).](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mct4c/)

If you are planning to take Grade 12 Advanced Functions, Grade 12 Calculus and Vectors, or a post-secondary program in a STEM field, be sure to take one of these courses first. Grade 11 math is a requirement of earning your OSSD, and while other math courses will meet this requirement, Grade 11 Functions may be needed, or at least extremely useful, for your chosen career pathway. On the other hand, you may have already taken Grade 12 Mathematics for College Technology, but now wish to change your pathway toward a university program. In that case, you can begin that journey by taking Grade 12 Advanced Functions.

## Advantages to Taking MHF4U Advanced Functions Online

Taking Advanced Functions as an online course has several advantages compared to taking it in traditional schools.

**Move at your own pace**

Many students consider Advanced Functions to be an intimidating course. With OVS, the ability to move through a course at your own pace is designed to be an advantage accessible to any student. One of the benefits of online high school is that if you’re having trouble with a particular lesson or concept, you can spend as much time as you need in mastering it, before eventually moving on to the next idea.

**Review any lesson at any time**

Many different concepts are studied in the Advanced Functions course. When approaching the end of a unit, or especially the end of the course, you may find it useful to return to old lessons for review. At traditional schools, students would have to rely on notes, or teachers choosing to dedicate extra time to review, but at [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), students can simply view the original lessons and materials again at any time.

**Multimedia lessons**

In a course like Advanced Functions, multimedia lessons can be crucial. From practice quizzes interspersed within lessons, to seamless transition between text and video, to interactive graphs and diagrams, multiple methods of communication can help to reach students with many different learning styles.

## Taking Advanced Functions as an Upgrade Course:

[Advanced Functions (Upgrade)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mhf4u-upgrade/), being a course that is important for entrance to many post-secondary programs, is one of our more popular Upgrade Courses. Many students may not realize that they can upgrade high school courses online, but Ontario Virtual School offers many [Upgrade Courses,](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/upgrade-courses/) designed for students who have already completed the course before, but wish to take it again so they can improve both their grade. These courses are condensed, and can be completed more quickly than standard courses, making them an ideal option for students in a variety of different academic situations

If you are interested in pursuing post-secondary education in a STEM field, taking Grade 12 Calculus and Vectors, or simply increasing your understanding of mathematics, then Grade 12 Advanced Functions may be the course for you. Even if you have already
