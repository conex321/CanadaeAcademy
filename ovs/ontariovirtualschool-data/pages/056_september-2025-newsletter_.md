Welcome Back! All of us at OVS are excited for that start of what is sure to be another fantastic school year. While OVS is a year-round school, offering programming throughout the summer, we also find that September comes with an influx of new students and enrollments.

In this newsletter, we will touch on some important information and dates that students will need to know in order to have a smooth school year ahead!

## OVS Summer Recap

This summer, OVS was hard at work both helping students complete their much-needed summer credits, but also with community outreach programs.

**OVS sponsors City of Brampton Canada Day celebration at Chinguacousy Park**

This year OVS helped to sponsor the Canada Day celebrations in Brampton. This event included live music, family friendly activities, food stalls, and much, much more.

OVS hosted a booth as a sponsor, where people could stop for a chat, learn about our program, play games, and collect some OVS swag.

The Honourable Mayor Patrick Brown and his team even dropped in to join us!

## OUAC Updates

![OUAC 2023](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/ouac_logo_stacked-2.png)

With the start of a new school year comes a new university application season.

First, here are some important basics for navigating the OUAC system, starting with understanding which applicant type you are.

**Group A applicants:**

* + - You are currently taking 1 or more courses at an Ontario high school
    - You are under 21 on or before December 31st 2025
    - You have an OSSD or are working towards an OSSD

If you do not meet the above criteria, you are a Group B applicant. Some examples of Group B applicants are:

* + - Not currently taking a course at an Ontario high school
    - A Canadian outside of Ontario
    - An international applicant
    - A postsecondary transfer student
    - A mature applicant
    - 21 or over, on or before December 31, 2025, and taking a course at an Ontario high school

For **Group B applicants**, there are some updates to the OUAC system this year. Ontario high schools are now able to report grades for full-time and part-time students over the age of 21.

So, if you are a Group B applicant, please let OVS know, and we can upload proof of enrollment, midterm and transcripts to support your application this year.

For more information, please check out the [OUAC Application Guide.](https://www.ouac.on.ca/guide/undergraduate-application-guide/)

## Ontario University Fairs

![ouf_logo_grey_box](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/ouf_logo_grey_box.png)

[**The OUF**](https://www.ouevents.ca/ouf/) takes place from September 27th to 28th 2025, at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre (MTCC) in the South Building.

The fair runs from 9:30am to 5pm both days and offers free admission.

This is a great opportunity for current high school students to talk with representatives from different universities and to really start thinking about where they might want to apply to for post-secondary.

![ourf_logo_grey_box](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/ourf_logo_grey_box.png)

Regional Fairs are similar to the OUF in that they allow students to connect directly with different university representatives to discuss their post-secondary plans and have their questions answered about what program might be right for them.

Regional Fairs take place in different cities ad local high school, university, and other community venues.

To check for Regional Fairs taking place near you, please check [**the schedule**](https://www.ouevents.ca/regional/).

![](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/ouis_logo_grey_box.png)

Another way high school students can gain valuable information about university programs is through online information sessions that don’t require any travel.

One of these sessions will be taking place November 10th between 5-7pm ET.

For more information and a full list of participating universities, please check out [**this website**](https://www.ouevents.ca/virtual/).

## Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test

![OSSLT 2025-2026](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/OSSLT-20252026-1.png)

As a graduation requirement Ontario high school students need to complete the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test (OSSLT).

Full-Time OVS students in Grade 10 or above **who are located in Ontario** will be required to complete the Literacy Test.

There are two sessions for the Literacy Test.

The Fall Literacy Test dates are between **November 4th 2025 and December 2nd 2025**.

The Winter Literacy Test dates are between **March 23rd 2026 and April 20th 2026**.

Full-Time OVS students who are not located in Toronto (so out of province or international students) can instead complete the OLC4O course.

## International Outreach

![grads 2025 Tenerife](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/grads-2025-tenerife.jpg)

As part of the OVS mission to help students around the world receive a high quality education, we like to bring that special personal touch when we can.

Last summer, OVS helped to bring several of our students studying the Dual Diploma program from the Tenerife Canary Islands to Canada, so that they could take an [ENG4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4u/) course in person as well as experience the many things Canada has to offer.

This year, 50 of those students graduated with their Ontario Secondary School Diploma.

OVS was invited to attend the graduation ceremony in person and connect with some of the students we’ve been able to help earn their Ontario Secondary School Diploma

Mr. Borzou Salavati attended the ceremony as an honoured guest, while Mr. Farhez Lakhani, our Head of International Partnerships, gave a speech focusing on the future of learning and how programs like the this one are bringing communities together.

They were honoured to be a part of the celebration and OVS is looking forward to continuing to make an impact on an international scale.
