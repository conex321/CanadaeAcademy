## It’s that time again!

Are you applying to university this year? Then you should be well aware that OUAC’s second collection period for midterms is happening right now! They will be collecting midterm marks until February 11th, but we are asking all students to submit their report requests a few days in advance to ensure everything runs smoothly. Check your course homepage for more details.

Just enrolled in a course and won’t make it to the midterm in time for this collection? Not to worry, the third (and final) collection period will run from March 15th until April 22nd.

*Already had your midterm processed, but forgot to have it sent to OUAC? Simply email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and we’ll have it updated in a jiff! Want universities to know you’re taking the course? Email us to have your enrollment submitted for all to see!*

###### Remember, in order for us to add any marks or enrollment to your OUAC profile, you need to first add “Ontario Virtual School” as an alternate school in the “Academic Information” section of your OUAC account. [This blog](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/understanding-the-2021-ouac-application/) will show you how!

## Your Thought Just Landed Here… Focusing on Your Mental Health

This month, we highlight the importance of keeping things simple! Here’s a sneak peak of Cheryl Millett’s latest blog, [“Keeping it Simple: The Key to Overall Health”](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/keep-it-simple/).

> When we think of modern society, the analogy of a ‘rat race’ often leaps to mind. More so than in any previous generation, today’s teens have more to watch, more to read, and more to do than ever before.
>
>
> The abundance of choice we have created for our kind is undoubtedly a modern wonder, but might it also be a curse?
>
>
> To avoid the curse of too much choice, we need to take a big step back. We must accept that we have limitations, and set goals according to those limits. We must learn when to say ‘yes’ and when to say ‘no.’ And, most importantly, when to say “no more”.
