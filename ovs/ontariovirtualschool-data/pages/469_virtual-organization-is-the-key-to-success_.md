While there are many habits and skills that contribute to academic success in high school, there is a great deal of [research](https://ijrpr.com/uploads/V4ISSUE4/IJRPR11525.pdf) to suggest that organization is a key component to optimal productivity and achievement. Depending on the type of course being studied and how the course is delivered, organization might look a little different in each case.

## National Clean Out Your Virtual Desktop Day

In North America, the 3rd Monday in October is informally acknowledged as [National Clean Out Your Virtual Desktop Day](https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/fun/national-clean-out-your-virtual-desktop-day). Back in 2010, this day was born out of the Personal Computer Museum in Brantford, Ontario, Canada, highlighting the importance of keeping our virtual workspaces as neat as our physical ones​​. While this is noted as a “fun holiday”, the intention and purpose behind this day has great value for academic success, especially for students who are pursuing their studies through an online virtual school, such as [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/).

## Importance of Organization

Students who [enrol in courses](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/register-online/) at Ontario Virtual School experience the benefit of completing entire courses online from the comfort of their own homes. Whether students learn and complete assignments from the couch in the living room, a table in the kitchen, or a desk in a bedroom, the common denominator between all 3 scenarios is the use of an electronic device, such as a computer, laptop or iPad.

Just like a physical desk, when these devices become cluttered and disorganized, it becomes more challenging and stressful to get work done quickly and efficiently. It becomes difficult to locate files, know what to do next, and access important tools for productivity.

## How to Observe National Clean Out Your Virtual Desktop Day

People who observe National Clean Out Your Virtual Desktop Day have offered suggestions on how to take full advantage of this day, especially for those who use a device frequently for school or work. Some of the [suggestions](https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/clean-your-virtual-desktop-day/) are as follows:

* Back up important files and sort through what you need and what you can delete
* Create folders for documents you want to keep
* Adopt a consistent file-naming system to locate documents easily
* Uninstall programs you no longer use
* Use cloud storage to keep files accessible without cluttering your computer
* Prioritize regular maintenance tasks like updates and cleaning the hardware itself
* Change your desktop decor to a calming landscape or colour palette

## Benefits of Virtual Desktop Organization

According to an article written in the [International Journal of Research Publication and Reviews](https://ijrpr.com/uploads/V4ISSUE4/IJRPR11525.pdf), the research suggests that “a clean and organized desk creates a sense of order and control, reduces stress and anxiety, enhances focus, and improves overall work performance” (Singh et. al, 2023, p. 1440). Whether students are taking just a couple of courses with OVS, such as [ENG4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4u/) online or [SBI4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sbi4u/) online, or completing their entire [Ontario high school diploma](https://www.ontario.ca/page/earning-your-high-school-diploma) online, organization is the key to online success. It supports students with time management online as well as avoiding procrastination in online classes.
