Mr. Michael  Principal
It is my sincere pleasure to be a part of the OVS team. Working alongside experienced teachers and support staff who are all committed to providing a thriving educational environment for our students is a distinct honour.

I started in education as a mathematics teacher after graduating from the Faculty of Education. After years of teaching high school math, I became a Department Head of Mathematics, Vice-Principal and Principal in the York Region DSB.

My passion turned to eLearning when it became clear that there are many students whose needs cannot be met in a day school. After a year of planning, I implemented eLearning in York Region with great success and was appointed Principal of its Virtual Schooling program.

Beyond education, I have spent many years as a volunteer with the Canadian Diabetes Association at the local, provincial, and national levels. In my spare time, I love to golf, camp, garden and do woodworking.

Let us all remember the quote by Carl W. Buechner:

> They may forget what you said, but they will never forget how you made them feel.
