# April 2025 Newsletter - Ontario Virtual School

**Source:** https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/april-2025-newsletter
**Description:** As April draws to a close, students can take a little breather now that midterm season has passed. It's important to take a step back and reflect on the work already complete and goals reached over the course of the semester so far. Getting to this point has been a difficult road for some and all students should be proud of their accomplishments.  While taking a moment to rest and reflect, students should still be aware of important deadlines for the end of the semester. This newsletter will go over those important OUAC deadlines, as well as highlighting new features, courses, and blogs with OVS.

As April draws to a close, students can take a little breather now that midterm season has passed. It’s important to take a step back and reflect on the work already completed and goals reached over the course of the semester so far. Getting to this point has been a difficult road for some and all students should be proud of their accomplishments.

While taking a moment to rest and reflect, students should still be aware of important deadlines for the end of the semester. This newsletter will go over those important [OUAC deadlines](https://guidance.ouac.on.ca/resources/schedule-of-dates/), as well as highlighting new features, courses, and blogs with OVS.

## OUAC Deadlines - Finals

![](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/OUAC-Collection-Period-4.png)

With the midterm deadline passing, it is essential to be aware of the next OUAC deadline dates, so that you can be prepared and plan the remainder of your OVS courses out ahead of time.

The **Opening Date** for OUAC final grades is **June 2nd 2025**.

The **Closing Date** for OUAC final grades is **July 7th 2025**.

To help our students ensure they are meeting these deadlines, OVS has set dates for our students to submit their work by in order to guarantee that their grades make it to OUAC by the final deadlines.

If you are a **Group 1** student, you need to have your work submitted to your teacher by no later than **June 5th 2025.**

If you are a **Group 2** student, you need to have your work submitted to your teacher by no later than **June 25th 2025.**

Please read below to determine which OVS Group you fall into.

![Which Group Am I?](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/Which-Group-Am-I-1024x654.png)

**Group 1** students are those who **need their OVS course to graduate high school** and are **NOT** a ***full-time*** student with OVS. Meaning that if you are attending another Ontario high school full-time and will be graduating from that high school, and not OVS, you are a Group 1 student.

**Group 2** students are students who are **FULL-TIME** with OVS and are earning their OSSD through our school *or*  **DO NOT** need their OVS course to graduate high school (but need the course for OUAC or other purposes).

**Group 1**

Group 1 students must have all work handed in by no later than ***June 5th, 2025. \*\* work will be accepted after this date however we will not be able to guarantee that the mark will be ready in time\*\**** This means that final exams MUST be written on or before this date to have a mark ready in time.

**Group 2**

Group 2 students must have all work handed in by no later than ***June 25th, 2025. \*\* work will be accepted after this date however we will not be able to guarantee that the mark will be ready in time\*\**** This means that final exams MUST be written on or before this date to have a mark ready in time.

The expectations for [Grade 6 Language](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/lan6g/) focuses on the consolidation of students’ language knowledge, skills, and strategies and their ability to use them independently and effectively to understand, reflect on, apply, and communicate information and ideas, and for continued learning in school and in a multicultural, multimedia world.

[Grade 11 The Individual and the Economy](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/cie3m/) course explores issues and challenges facing the Canadian economy as well as the implications of various responses to them. Students will explore the economic role of firms, workers, and government as well as their own role as individual consumers and contributors, and how all of these roles contribute to stability and change in the Canadian economy.

## Sariah Sain

![Sariah Sain](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/IMG_6114.jpg)

Sariah is a competitive swimmer located in Costa Rica. She decided to complete her high school education with OVS so that she could have the flexible study schedule she needs in order to continue her training.

She is currently enrolled in [Grade 11 University English](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng3u/) and [Grade 12 International Business Fundamentals](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/bbb4m/) with OVS, with plans to enroll in more. She chose these two subjects to start with in part because she wants to build her English language skills. Her first language is Spanish, with German and English as her second language. By taking university level English with OVS, she can be prepared for attending college in the future. She also plans on focusing on business for her post-secondary studies, so taking International Business with OVS felt like it would be a good stepping stone to get started.

We asked Sariah a few questions regarding her enrollment with OVS so far, to read the interview check out our [Spotlight Page.](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/student-spotlight/sariah-sain/)

As an educator with Ontario Virtual School (OVS), I recognize the importance of teaching students how to effectively balance their nutritional goals while completing online OSSD credits. In HFA4U, Nutrition and Health, once students learn about the significance of nutrition during adolescence and its pivotal role in long-term health, they are eager to follow nutritional guidelines highlighted in Canada’s Food Guide. However, the main barrier I encounter is a lack of time. Here are a few strategies to stay on track without compromising your nutrition and health!

When you think of science class, you may conjure up images of lab coats, animal dissections, and chemistry sets. However, as a significant number of students turn to online schools, like the Ontario Virtual School, teachers have had to adapt the methods in which students perform practical activities. These hands-on learning experiences are not always possible in the virtual learning environment, so teachers have opted to utilize virtual lab simulations. Hands-on approaches have been the standard until recently, which is causing many students and parents to wonder: do virtual labs measure up?
