## Fundamental Concepts Covered in Grade 11 World History Online Course

The framework of course delivery focuses on the “big ideas” which provide context for the overall expectations. The big ideas reflect the enduring understandings that students retain from their learning, transfer to other subjects, and draw upon throughout their lives. These enduring understandings include: (1) The concepts of historical thinking (2) The historical inquiry process

## Online Teaching and Learning Strategies

The mathematical processes are to be integrated into student learning in all areas of this course.
Throughout this course, students will:

* **Problem Solving** – develop, select, apply, compare, and adapt a variety of problem-solving strategies as they pose and solve problems and conduct investigations, to help deepen their mathematical understanding
* **Reasoning and Proving** – develop and apply reasoning skills (e.g., use of inductive reasoning, deductive
   reasoning, and counter-examples; construction of proofs) to make mathematical
   conjectures, assess conjectures, and justify conclusions, and plan and construct
   organized mathematical arguments;
* **Reflecting** – demonstrate that they are reflecting on and monitoring their thinking to help clarify their understanding as they complete an investigation or solve a problem (e.g., by assessing the effectiveness of strategies and processes used, by proposing alternative approaches, by judging the reasonableness of results, by verifying solutions)
* **Selecting Tools and Computational Strategies** – select and use a variety of concrete, visual, and electronic learning tools and appropriate computational strategies to investigate mathematical ideas and to solve problems
* **Connecting** – make connections among mathematical concepts and procedures, and relate mathematical ideas to situations or phenomena drawn from other contexts (e.g., other curriculum areas, daily life, current events, art and culture, sports)
* **Representing** – create a variety of representations of mathematical ideas (e.g., numeric, geometric, algebraic, graphical, pictorial representations; onscreen dynamic representations), connect and compare them, and select and apply the appropriate representations to solve problems
* **Communicating** – communicate mathematical thinking orally, visually, and in writing, using precise mathematical vocabulary and a variety of appropriate representations, and observing mathematical conventions

## Assessment & Evaluation

As summarized in [Growing Success 2010](http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/success.html), the primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning. Information gathered through assessment helps teachers to determine students’ strengths and weaknesses and adapt curriculum and instructional approaches accordingly.

As part of assessment, teachers provide students with descriptive feedback to help guide their learning Evaluation refers to the process of measuring the quality of work against an established criteria, and assigning a value representative of work quality. All curriculum expectations must be accounted for in instruction, but evaluation focuses on students’ achievement of the overall expectations.

A students’ achievement is evaluated in relation to specific expectations. Teachers use their professional judgement to determine which specific expectations should be used to evaluate achievement of overall expectations, and which ones will be covered in instruction and assessment but not used as an evaluation benchmark. To ensure assessment and evaluation are valid and fair teachers use assessment and evaluation strategies that:

* Address both what students learn and how well they learn
* Are based on the achievement level descriptions given in the achievement chart
* Are varied in nature, administered over time, and designed to provide opportunities for students to demonstrate the full range of their learning
* Are appropriate for the learning activities used, the purposes of instruction, and the needs and experiences of the students
* Are fair to all students
* Accommodate students with special education needs, consistent with the strategies outlined in their Individual Education Plan
* Accommodate the needs of students who are learning the language of instruction
* Ensure that each student is given clear directions for improvement
* Promote students’ ability to assess their own learning and to set specific goals
* Include student work samples as evidence their achievement
* Are communicated clearly to students and parents at the beginning of the school year and at other appropriate points throughout the school year.

The achievement chart outlines four categories of knowledge and skills:

1. Knowledge and understanding
2. Critical thinking
3. Communication
4. Application

Teachers assess and/or evaluate work in a balanced manner with respect to the four categories. A final grade is recorded, and a credit is granted and recorded for this course if the student’s grade is 50% or higher. The final grade for this course will be determined as follows:

**Seventy percent of the grade** is based on evaluations conducted throughout the course. This portion of the grade reflects the student’s most consistent level of achievement throughout the course, although special consideration should be given to more recent evidence of achievement.

**Thirty percent of the grade** is based on a final evaluation and administered towards the end of the course.

## Special Accommodations for Students with an IEP

Every single student is capable of success. Some students are able, with certain [accommodations](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/iep-accommodations/), to participate in the regular course curriculum and demonstrate independent learning.

[Accommodations](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/iep-accommodations/) allow access to the course without any changes to the [knowledge and skills the student is expected to demonstrate](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/assessment-evaluation/). The accommodations required to facilitate the student’s learning are identified by the teacher. Recommendations from a School Board generated [Individual Education Plan (IEP)](https://www.specialeducationguide.com/pre-k-12/individualized-education-programs-iep/the-iep-process-explained/) if available can also be consulted. Instruction based on principles of universal design and differentiated make it possible to meet the diverse needs of all learners.

**Examples of accommodations (but not limited to) include:**

* Adjusting or extending assessment deadlines
* Providing alternative assignments or summative tasks
* Use of scribes and/or other assistive technologies
* Simplifying the language of instruction

My experience with OVS was awesome. I enrolled in the BAF3M-04 Grade 11 Accounting Course and my teacher was Mr. Scott Lewis. The quality of the lessons and learning materials were great and I had no issues with them. There were absolutely NO hidden fees. What I loved the most is how fast and quickly Mr. Lewis marked and returned my assessments. He’d usually hand them back the next day. Admin support was amazing, they helped me with the scheduling of my exam and they were really nice and understanding of the situation. Also, you get 1 year to finish the whole course, but, they also give students an extra week on top of the 1 year deadline. This really helped me when I had to do my exam, I didn’t have to stress about how little time I had left to finish the course in time.
Ontario Virtual School is a great option for people who want to learn online. I highly recommend it.

I was a bit hesitant to complete the CHW3M course online with OVS but was extremely happy with the outcome! It was an amazing way to learn all the content and with the support of my teacher, Ms. Carone, it was an amazing experience! Learning has truly never been more of a pleasant experience and the amount of feedback, as well as quick replies from teachers, allowed me to grow further as a student. I couldn't have asked for a better time at OVS and would 100% recommend it to all students!

I took BAF3M-04 (accounting) and learned a lot of useful things. The quality and materials of the lessons were really informative and quite easy to follow and the assessments used a variety of questions to test my knowledge. Fortunately, there were no hidden fees and the process of receiving my report card was always short and easy. My teachers would always respond to my questions and would mark my work within 48 hours. Overall, I really enjoyed the course and support received from the school.
