Journalism today looks very different than it has in the past. People use to get access to news and information only through printed newspaper or journals, the radio, or television. In this day and age though, it’s easier than ever for people to access information about the world around them. While newspapers and journals are still printed, they are also available online, easily within reach. However, with modern technology, it can also be difficult for people to sort out fact from fiction and find reliable and accurate information.

That is why it is essential to have trusted news sources in the world, and people trained to provide information in a clear, organized, and unbiased manner. With modern journalism, journalists are not only trained on how to do informed research and write, but also on the use of technology and various media platforms.

Whether you have an interest in writing, media or other broadcast journalism as a potential future career, there are some wonderful college programs that can help provide you with the training you need to be successful.
