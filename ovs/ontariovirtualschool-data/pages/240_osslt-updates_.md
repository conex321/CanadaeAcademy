As a graduation requirement Ontario high school students need to complete the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test (OSSLT).

The Literacy Test is run by [EQAO,](https://www.eqao.com/) available only at certain times throughout the year.

Full-Time OVS students in Grade 10 or above **who are located in Ontario** will be required to complete the Literacy Test.

#### There are two sessions for the Literacy Test:

* + The Fall Literacy Test dates are between **November 4th 2025 and December 2nd 2025**.
  + The Winter Literacy Test dates are between **March 23rd 2026 and April 20th 2026**.

Full-Time OVS students who are not located in Toronto (so out of province or international students) can instead complete the OLC4O course.
