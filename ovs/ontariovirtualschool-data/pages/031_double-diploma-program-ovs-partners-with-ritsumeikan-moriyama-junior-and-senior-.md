A Double Diploma, or Dual Diploma program, allows students to earn multiple diplomas simultaneously. Typically, this involves students obtaining a high school diploma from their home country, along with an additional diploma from an international school.

Ontario Virtual School (OVS) is uniquely equipped to help students achieve this goal by offering flexible online courses that can be integrated into their existing high school schedules. This makes it easier for students to participate in multiple educational programs at the same time.

OVS partners with several programs that offer Dual Diploma options. This past October, we expanded our global network by launching a new Double Diploma partnership with **Ritsumeikan Moriyama Junior and Senior High School (RM)** in Japan.

## Ritsumeikan Moriyama High School

Located in Moriyama, Shiga, Japan, [Ritsumeikan Moriyama](https://www.ritsumori.ed.jp) is known for its strong English language education, excellent athletic programs, and commitment to developing global leaders.

As part of its mission to prepare students for success on a global scale, RM offers many opportunities for international travel. For example, their Grade 11 students can participate in a [two-week program](https://www.ritsumori.ed.jp/go_out.html) that allows them to visit countries such as the Canada, USA, Australia, and Finland. During these trips, students engage in internships, entrepreneurship training, environmental studies, and more.

For their Grade 12 students, RM offers full exchange programs, allowing them to study abroad for several months up to a full year. These international experiences are designed to enhance students’ global perspectives and skills.

In their continued pursuit of educational growth, RM has now partnered with OVS to provide students even greater access to quality international education.
