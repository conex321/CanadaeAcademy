February is ending and March is fast approaching, which means students are well and truly into their second semester of the school year (for those in semester-based institutions).

OVS is hard as work, not only recruiting new partnerships and students, but also ensuring our current students are well aware of their approaching post-secondary deadlines.

## OUAC Deadlines

![OUAC Collection Period 3 2025](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/OUAC-Collection-Period-3-1.png)

As we are getting further in to the second semester, it’s important for Grade 12 students to be aware of all deadlines in regards to their university applications.

OUAC Collection Period Three begins on **March 17th** and concludes on **April 24th**. This collection period is for all in progress and midterm grades for second semester.

It is essential to meet this deadline as most university acceptances are determined at the end of this collection period.

In order to make sure students meet this important deadline, the OVS deadline for submitting work is **April 14th.** You must submit all midterm work by this date to ensure that your marks go into OUAC in time.

If work is submitted after this date, it will still be marked, however, we cannot guarantee that your midterm grade will be submitted to OUAC by the deadline.

## Podcast

## Ontario Literacy Test

![Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test Blog Photo Spring Sessions](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/Ontario-Secondary-School-Literacy-Test-Blog-Photo-Spring-Session.png)

The [**Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test**](https://www.eqao.com/the-assessments/osslt/) is a requirement for earning your OSSD. This test is designed to measure whether students are meeting the minimum standard for literacy across all subjects. Generally, this test is administered during the Grade 10 year, but it can be completed at any time during high school.

International or out-of-province students with OVS are eligible to take the OLC4O course, instead of being required to complete the literacy test. However, students based in Ontario are required to complete the test in order to earn their OSSD.

If you are a full-time OVS student based in Ontario, we have a OSSLT test session coming up this spring. The test sessions will run from **March 18th to April 15th 2025.**

Once students have selected a session, they will be asked to pay a $200 fee. This fee covers the testing and includes a teacher-facilitated preparation module with lessons, practice exams from previous years, and more to help students prepare for this mandatory test.

If you have questions regarding the OSSLT requirement, please contact the OVS office at [**[email protected]**](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#badbded7d3d4fad5d4cedbc8d3d5ccd3c8cecfdbd6c9d9d2d5d5d694d9db)
