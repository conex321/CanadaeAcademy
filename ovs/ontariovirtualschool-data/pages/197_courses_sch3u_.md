## Fundamental Concepts Covered in Grade 11 Chemistry Online Course

This course enables students to deepen their understanding of chemistry through the study of the properties of chemicals and chemical bonds; chemical reactions and quantitative relationships in those reactions; solutions and solubility; and atmospheric chemistry and the behaviour of gases. Students will further develop their analytical skills and investigate the qualitative and quantitative properties of matter, as well as the impact of some common chemical reactions on society and the environment.

## Online Teaching and Learning Strategies

Teachers will bring enthusiasm and varied teaching and assessment approaches to the classroom, addressing individual students’ needs and ensuring sound learning opportunities for every student. The activities offered should enable students to relate and apply these concepts to the social, environmental, and economical conditions and concerns of the world in which they live. Opportunities to relate knowledge and skills to these wider contexts will motivate students to learn in a meaningful way and to become life-long learners. Teachers will help students understand that problem solving of any kind often requires a considerable expenditure of time and energy and a good deal of perseverance. Teachers also will encourage students to investigate, to reason, to explore alternative solutions and to take the risks necessary to become successful problem solvers. Effective instructional approaches and learning activities draw on students’ prior knowledge, capture their interest, and encourage meaningful practise both inside and outside the classroom. Students will be engaged when they are able to see the connection between the scientific concepts they are learning and their application in the world around them and in real-life situations. Due to its importance, students will have opportunities to learn in a variety of ways- individually, cooperatively, independently, with teacher direction, through hands-on experiences, and through examples followed by practice. The approaches and strategies teachers use will vary according to both the object of the learning and the needs of the students. Teachers will accomplish this in online environment with the use of: virtual labs, online simulations, animations, videos, discussion forums, live chat and other interactive objects.

## Assessment & Evaluation

As summarized in [Growing Success 2010](http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/success.html), the primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning. Information gathered through assessment helps teachers to determine students’ strengths and weaknesses and adapt curriculum and instructional approaches accordingly.

As part of assessment, teachers provide students with descriptive feedback to help guide their learning Evaluation refers to the process of measuring the quality of work against an established criteria, and assigning a value representative of work quality. All curriculum expectations must be accounted for in instruction, but evaluation focuses on students’ achievement of the overall expectations.

A students’ achievement is evaluated in relation to specific expectations. Teachers use their professional judgement to determine which specific expectations should be used to evaluate achievement of overall expectations, and which ones will be covered in instruction and assessment but not used as an evaluation benchmark. To ensure assessment and evaluation are valid and fair teachers use assessment and evaluation strategies that:

* Address both what students learn and how well they learn
* Are based on the achievement level descriptions given in the achievement chart
* Are varied in nature, administered over time, and designed to provide opportunities for students to demonstrate the full range of their learning
* Are appropriate for the learning activities used, the purposes of instruction, and the needs and experiences of the students
* Are fair to all students
* Accommodate students with special education needs, consistent with the strategies outlined in their Individual Education Plan
* Accommodate the needs of students who are learning the language of instruction
* Ensure that each student is given clear directions for improvement
* Promote students’ ability to assess their own learning and to set specific goals
* Include student work samples as evidence their achievement
* Are communicated clearly to students and parents at the beginning of the school year and at other appropriate points throughout the school year.

The achievement chart outlines four categories of knowledge and skills:

1. Knowledge and understanding
2. Critical thinking
3. Communication
4. Application

Teachers assess and/or evaluate work in a balanced manner with respect to the four categories. A final grade is recorded, and a credit is granted and recorded for this course if the student’s grade is 50% or higher. The final grade for this course will be determined as follows:

**Seventy percent of the grade** is based on evaluations conducted throughout the course. This portion of the grade reflects the student’s most consistent level of achievement throughout the course, although special consideration should be given to more recent evidence of achievement.

**Thirty percent of the grade** is based on a final evaluation and administered towards the end of the course.

## Special Accommodations for Students with an IEP

Every single student is capable of success. Some students are able, with certain [accommodations](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/iep-accommodations/), to participate in the regular course curriculum and demonstrate independent learning.

[Accommodations](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/iep-accommodations/) allow access to the course without any changes to the [knowledge and skills the student is expected to demonstrate](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/assessment-evaluation/). The accommodations required to facilitate the student’s learning are identified by the teacher. Recommendations from a School Board generated [Individual Education Plan (IEP)](https://www.specialeducationguide.com/pre-k-12/individualized-education-programs-iep/the-iep-process-explained/) if available can also be consulted. Instruction based on principles of universal design and differentiated make it possible to meet the diverse needs of all learners.

**Examples of accommodations (but not limited to) include:**

* Adjusting or extending assessment deadlines
* Providing alternative assignments or summative tasks
* Use of scribes and/or other assistive technologies
* Simplifying the language of instruction

I was missing Grade 11 Chemistry (SCH3U) for college applications and was referred to OVS as an option to fulfill this requirement. Flexibility and time-allowance of a year were the best parts of this course. These aspects allowed me to keep up with my day-school responsibilities, while knowing that I could get back to the OVS course when my school assignments were finished. Majority of the course was done during my summer break and so I was able to give it the time and effort required in order to complete and give it my best. The online lessons were well structured and had ample supported explanations. The homework/extra practice given at the end of most lessons was manageable and related well to the units. There were no hidden fees. For the Unit 2 test, I felt it was more challenging than the Unit 2 lessons, however, for the rest of the lessons the tests were a fair representation of their respective units. Additionally, the practice test for the final exam was more challenging than the actual exam, which in-effect prepared me well for the actual final exam. Admin support was phenomenal as they would respond very quickly, keeping in the time difference. My teacher, Ms. Aparajita Moulick, was great with responding to my emails and answered any questions that I had. She also gave constructive feedback on my labs and tests that helped me improve as the course progressed. Since this was a self-study online course, it was important to be organized, stay on task, meet deadlines and most of all be self-motivated. I am delighted that such opportunities are available for students, to help them fulfill missing requirements should they need to. Thank you OVS!

My experience with OVS was awesome. I enrolled in the BAF3M-04 Grade 11 Accounting Course and my teacher was Mr. Scott Lewis. The quality of the lessons and learning materials were great and I had no issues with them. There were absolutely NO hidden fees. What I loved the most is how fast and quickly Mr. Lewis marked and returned my assessments. He’d usually hand them back the next day. Admin support was amazing, they helped me with the scheduling of my exam and they were really nice and understanding of the situation. Also, you get 1 year to finish the whole course, but, they also give students an extra week on top of the 1 year deadline. This really helped me when I had to do my exam, I didn’t have to stress about how little time I had left to finish the course in time.
Ontario Virtual School is a great option for people who want to learn online. I highly recommend it.

I took BAF3M-04 (accounting) and learned a lot of useful things. The quality and materials of the lessons were really informative and quite easy to follow and the assessments used a variety of questions to test my knowledge. Fortunately, there were no hidden fees and the process of receiving my report card was always short and easy. My teachers would always respond to my questions and would mark my work within 48 hours. Overall, I really enjoyed the course and support received from the school.
