How to engage in discussion forums online to get the most from them
Many students groan at the thought of discussion forums. Until they experience the perspective of an instructor who is able to read the wonderful insightful thoughts that students wrote to each other, these benefits go unnoticed by many. Students don’t always recognize just how valuable these forums can be, especially when they learn how to use them effectively.

Discussion forums foster meaningful learning. They can help develop critical thinking, communication, collaboration and course-specific skills. The key is knowing how to use them. At [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), discussion forums are one of the multiple opportunities to apply their knowledge. Here are five tips and reasons to engage in discussion forums effectively.

## 1. Respectfully Engage With Posts that Differ from Your Opinions

Students often avoid responding to posts that express viewpoints different from their own. Discussion forums, however, are an ideal space to practice communicating with varying opinions. Intentionally engaging with differing viewpoints allows you to:

* Practice organizing and expressing your ideas clearly and respectfully
* Encourages you to remain open-minded
* The original writer of the post can interact with others without feeling put-on-the-spot.

When commenting on a post with a differing view than your own, keep the following in mind:

* Don’t take their post, or frame your response personally
* Stay open-minded
* Use “I… statements”
* It’s not a debate, it’s a discussion

Remember that discussion forums are designed to promote learning and engagement. When your instructor asks for your thoughts, they aren’t asking for an argument, they’re asking you to consider and engage with others, even through the differences. At [OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), we provide you with the platform and opportunity to engage in these meaningful and safe discussions.

## 2. Share your theories and ideas that you wouldn’t otherwise share

As you work through your Introduction to [Psychology, Sociology, and Anthropology (HSP3U) course](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/hsp3u/), you might find yourself making exciting connections between a course concept and its application in the real world. Discussion posts allow you to practice sharing your ideas and real world experiences to fellow students who can appreciate your connections. Sharing your thoughts and ideas may feel intimidating, but forums offer a place to post your ideas with pride, unlike assignments that are only shared with the instructor. You may even find yourself making a friend in online high school through your discussions!

## 3. Ask (the right) questions!

Questions in courses are not just for your instructor, they are for your peers too. Learning to ask the right questions helps you demonstrate critical thinking and is a skill you will use beyond your online course. Discussion forums often prompt students to respond to a peer with a question. Here are some tips to consider when asking questions in discussion forums:

* Engage with the material
  + Explicitly reference course material. For example, in your [Grade 12 Business Leadership course (BOH4M)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/boh4m/#iframe_container), you may reference Fayolism in your discussion and discuss its application.
* Ask open-ended questions
  + Avoid asking questions that can be answered with a simple “yes” or “no” by using statements such as “where do you see the application of…” or “what do you think of…”
* Think about the learning outcomes
  + [OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/) provides students with the learning outcomes at the beginning of each lesson. Reflect on these and gear your questions towards this outcome.

Applying these tips can help guide your questions and therefore, your learning. When you obtain an Ontario online high school diploma, the diploma you hold does not just demonstrate your ability to complete course work, but it shows you can apply critical thinking, which stems from asking the right questions. These question tips can be applied to any course, from [SBI4U (Grade 12 Biology)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sbi4u/) to [CLN4U (Canadian and International Law)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/cln4u/).

## 4. Gain the benefits of collaborative learning, without the risk

Collaborative learning refers to “groups of learners working together to solve a problem, complete a task, or create a product” (Laal & Ghodsbi, 2011). It promotes critical thinking, develops community, reduces anxiety and provides a better understanding of content. With collaborative learning often comes group projects, which can create challenges – the work may be unevenly distributed between members, or, the quality of work between members may differ. Discussion forums offer a lower risk, high reward outcome for participants. It allows students to engage with their peers in meaningful discussions, while maintaining independence and responsibility for one’s own work. Participating in discussion forums provides the benefits of collaborative learning, without risking your grade or time.

## 5. Show your Learning skills and Study Effectively

OVS offers optional discussion forums in many courses. Participation in these discussions can speak highly to your learning skills and work habits (alongside developing them) as they are optional. Completing the optional assessment as/of learning activities (student takes responsibility by monitoring their progress), shows your instructor your initiative and your responsibility. These forums can serve as direct evidence of your learning skills, and are a method of studying the material. This allows students to put into practice what they’ve learned before applying it to assignments that are weighed more. Furthermore, they provide students with the opportunity to complete further research on topics of interest, to actively engage in the material and to hear perspectives they may not have thought of, which is a method of solidifying what you’ve learned (Blackmon, n.d), and helps students practice skills, such as referencing when researching. In other words, participating in your [ENG4U (Grade 12 English)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4u/) discussion forum will help you achieve a higher mark on your [ENG4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4u/) final essay. In courses such as [English 12 online](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4u/), these discussion forums also help students practice the communication skills that are vital to course content, and [the Secondary School Literacy Course/Test](https://www.eqao.com/the-assessments/osslt/).

Discussion forums are far more than time-fillers, they are valuable tools in learning. When used properly, they can benefit students beyond their [OVS courses](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/grade-11/). At [OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=8124724051&gbraid=0AAAAADm07CnZvQLnaap2Pd06S0kjP1Ebq&gclid=CjwKCAiA_orJBhBNEiwABkdmjJIdDfFdEGZWVaJRYmVZig_46lQnprEG_sF23lS_Ai0Ug63ci6fERRoCK40QAvD_BwE), we provide students with the best tools to enhance their learning and its application for their future.
