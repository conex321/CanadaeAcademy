Preparing to apply to university can be stressful. Many students and parents want to make sure they are doing the right thing, at the right time and in the right way in order to ensure university acceptance. Whether it’s studying for high marks, taking on school leadership roles or volunteering in the community, it’s hard to know what to focus on and what will be the key to success.

## The “Secret” to University Admissions

The truth of the matter, however, is that there isn’t one single “magic recipe” that will guarantee post-secondary admissions. So instead of focusing on checking boxes and securing titles, students should focus on becoming who they are truly meant to be. Becoming a well-rounded person who is passionate and self-reflective will ultimately have a greater chance of being recognized by a university and be given the opportunity to pursue studies at their institution.

## What Really Matters for University Admissions

* **Start with understanding fit.**The strongest applications come from students who genuinely align with a program’s values, goals, and learning environment. When students spend time exploring programs and understanding what they’re looking for, their applications naturally become clearer and more intentional.
* **Show steady commitment, not quick fixes.**Universities notice patterns. Regular weekly actions, meaningful involvement, and slow, steady progress say far more about a student’s character than a flurry of last-minute activity before deadlines.
* **Focus on passion, not prestige.**A meaningful project that students have nurtured over months or years leaves a bigger impression than a list of leadership positions that required minimal involvement. Admissions teams value depth, curiosity, and sincerity over titles.
* **Be able to explain the “why.”**A strong application doesn’t just list experiences, it shows learning. Reflection in essays, portfolios, or interviews helps admissions officers understand how each activity shaped the student and why it mattered.
* **Aim to contribute in a real way.**Students who actually make an impact, whether on their school, team, community, or personal project, stand out naturally. It’s rare, and that’s why it gets noticed.

## How OVS Helps Students Focus on What Really Matters

As an [accredited online high school](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/private-school-contact-information) in Ontario, [OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/about-us/) provides students with flexible learning pathways so that students can focus on what really matters. One of the greatest advantages of online high school with OVS is that the courses are self-paced. Because of this, students have greater ownership over their schedule and this allows them to focus on other initiatives. So, whether it’s going above and beyond the 40 volunteer hour requirement for graduation or using the flexible time to participate in meaningful extracurricular activities, students have greater choice on how to use their time, energy and talents.
