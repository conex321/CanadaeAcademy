As we enter the winter months, many senior students are gearing up for submitting their post-secondary applications and making sure they have what they need to not only apply for post-secondary programs but ensure that they meet all of their graduation requirements as well.

In this newsletter we’ll touch on some important dates for students applying to both college and university.

## OUAC Updates and Deadlines

For students who are graduating this year and applying to university, it’s important to know the important deadlines for submitted documents through the [Ontario University Application Centre](https://www.ouac.on.ca/planning/deadlines/). Especially, since OUAC applications are a little different this year and you no longer need a PIN from your school to start the application process.

For more information on the new OUAC application and how to create an account please check out our blog.

Here are the important upcoming dates for the 2023-2024 OUAC submissions.

* + - * **January 15th:** The deadline for all current Ontario high school students to submit their completed applications to the OUAC.
      * **February 22nd:** Target date for Ontario universities to receive all final grades available for 4U/M courses and current full-year grades for 4U/M courses from the OUAC.
      * **May 2nd:** Target date for Ontario universities to receive all midterm or final grades available for 4U/M courses and interim grades for full-year courses from the OUAC.
      * **July 11th**: Target date for the OUAC to send all remaining final grades to the Ontario universities.

To ensure your records are submitted, make sure to add OVS as one of the schools you’re attending in your Academic Background/Information section of your OUAC account. Also, when requesting midterm and final grades, make sure to check off that you’re a Undergraduate applicant, so we know to send your grades when we process them.

## OCAS Updates and Deadlines

For Grade 12 students who are applying to college for next year, many of you will be submitting applications through the [Ontario College Application Service (OCAS).](https://www.ocas.ca/support/high-school-partners/important-dates-fall-2024#:~:text=February%201%2C%202024,are%20highest%20at%20this%20time.) While there are general deadlines through OCAS, each college will have specific deadlines for their programs, so it’s important to check out your college’s website for more information.

Here are the important upcoming dates for the 2023-2024 OCAS submissions.

* + - * **February 1st:** The deadline for applying to highly competitive programs. Applications received and paid for on or before this date will be given equal consideration by the colleges.
      * **February 16th:** The deadline for first semester final marks and currently enrolled second semester courses.
      * **April 26th:** The deadlines for second semester midterm marks. For non-semestered schools.
      * **July 5th:** The deadline for all final marks and proof of graduation, regardless of the scheduling model.

In order for OVS to send your grades to OCAS, we need to know your OCAS Account number. When requesting midterms and final grades from OVS, you can input this number into the form, which let’s our staff know to submit your records to OCAS.

## Student Spotlight

Masaru decided to join OVS as a student from Japan and wanted to earn his OSSD to apply to Canadian universities. He found taking courses with OVS was an economical and efficient way to earn the OSSD while studying outside of Canada. By earning his diploma online, he was able to participate in extracurricular activities alongside his academics.

He completed his grade 12 year with us, taking courses to assist him in not only graduating but applying to the Computer Science program at University of Toronto. He completed English ([**ENG4U**](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4u/) and[**OLC4O**](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/olc4o/)), Mathematics ([**MHF4U**](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mhf4u/), [**MCV4U**](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mcv4u/) and [**MDM4U**](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mdm4u/)), Computer Science ([**ICS3U**](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/ics3u/) and [**ICS4U**](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/ics4u/)), and Physics ([**SPH4U**](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sph4u/)), earning all A’s in his courses.

We asked Masaru a few questions about his experiences with OVS, which you can check out on [our website](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/student-spotlight/masaru-morisako/).
