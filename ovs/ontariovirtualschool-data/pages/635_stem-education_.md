## ONTARIO VIRTUAL SCHOOL (OVS) (OVS) IS COMMITTED TO STEM-ENRICHED EDUCATION

A focus on the conceptual framework of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) is absolutely necessary for the educational future of our students.

OVS is continuously testing and breaking new ground in bridging these disciplines by fusing them with interactive Gizmos, especially in Math and Science courses.

With the use of Gizmos, OVS is making connections across the STEM disciplines and preparing students for the real world.

Discover Concepts

Interactive design allows for extensive manipulation of variables and “what-if” experimentation.

Analyze Data

Visualizations and graphing tools help capture and compare results from experiments.

Go Deeper

In-depth activities create more moments to explore, discover and apply new concepts.
