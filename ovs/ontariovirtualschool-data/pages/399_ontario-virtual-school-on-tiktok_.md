## TikTok Takeover

Since its launch in 2016, TikTok has almost reached the same user base numbers as Youtube and Meta platforms. TikTok reached 1.92 billion users in 2023, and is expected to reach 2 billion users by the end of 2024. And teens use it for more than just trending dances! In a digital research study completed by researchers at Study.com, 1,000 American students were interviewed on their uses of TikTok for educational purposes, and 1,000 TikToks were analyzed based on their education hashtags. Before selecting their TikTok video sample, they did a preliminary survey of 4,156 American students to see if students used TikTok for school.

Out of 4,156 students surveyed, 1,000 students said they used the app for education purposes. The researchers conducted a semi-structured interview with the 1,000 student participants to determine how and why they used TikTok for education purposes. Then 1,000 Tiktoks were sourced based on their education related hashtag. They recorded the topics and concepts that were covered in those sampled videos to determine if there were patterns and trends on what was being discussed.
