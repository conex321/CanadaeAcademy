For students who are graduating this year and applying to university, it’s important to know the deadlines for submitting documents through the [Ontario University Application Centre](https://www.ouac.on.ca/guide/undergrad-dates). Especially, since OUAC applications are a little different this year and you no longer need a PIN from your school to start the application process.

For more information on the new OUAC application and how to create an account please check out our [blog](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/understanding-the-new-2023-ouac-undergraduate-application/).

Here are the important upcoming dates for the 2023-2024 OUAC submissions.

To ensure your records are submitted, make sure to add OVS as one of the schools you’re attending in your Academic Background/Information section of your OUAC account.
