**What are the benefits of being a full-time student with OVS?**

Our courses are available 24/7, 365 days a year, meaning you can study *when* you want and *where* you want! And, with continuous enrollment, you’re completely free to set your own timeline and schedule! Opt to work on fewer courses (or the easier ones) during times when you’re busiest in your personal life, and save the bulk of your learning for your off-season! Have something that keeps you busy year-round? No problem! With OVS, you are also free to decide how long you take to earn your OSSD. So, whether you stick to the traditional 4-year model, work year-round to complete it even faster, or choose to space your 30 credits out over 5 or 6 years, [our dedicated administrators and instructors](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/meet-our-staff/) will be there to help you every step of the way! Did we mention we’ll also help you apply to post-secondary when the time comes? We automatically submit your report cards to [OUAC](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ouac-info-updates/) and [OCAS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ocas-info-updates/), as long as your applicant numbers are included. We can also email your reports and/or transcripts directly to your admissions officer(s), all you have to do is ask!

**Are there any discounts available for full-time students?**

Students enrolling with a full-time course load of 8 courses per year are eligible to receive $400 off their annual cost – just ask us how! Keep in mind, our course fees already include all applicable taxes and administrative fees, as well as course materials and access to our amazing year-round customer support!

**Are there any required courses you don’t offer?**

Nope! We offer all of the [compulsory credits](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/OSSD-Requirements.pdf), meaning you could start from grade 9 and work your way through all 30 credits with us, if you so choose! We also have a wide range of elective courses available at the [Grade 11](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/grade-11/) and [12](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/grade-12/) levels, meaning you can cater your course selection to the post-secondary path of your choice!

**Will OVS be able to graduate me?**

Absolutely! Over the years, we have graduated dozens of students, with many more currently working towards [diploma completion](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ossd-requirements/). If it is your intention to have us graduate you, please send an email with your most up-to-date transcript to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f293969f9b9cb29d9c8693809b9d849b808687939e81919a9d9d9edc9193) so we can help you put together a course plan and discuss [community service](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/images/CIH/CommunityInvolvementForm.pdf) and [OSSLT](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/osslt/) administration details.

**Will I still get an actual diploma or is it just an online certificate?**

Each and every student who graduates from Ontario Virtual School will receive a standard Ministry-issued diploma mailed to their home, ready to be framed and displayed proudly!

**Will a diploma from OVS get me into the post-secondary institution of my choice?**

[Yes](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/university-college-admission-officers/)! OVS is fully accredited by the Ontario Ministry of Education to grant OSSD credits and graduate qualifying students with an official Ontario Secondary School Diploma, which is accepted by post-secondary institutions around the world!
