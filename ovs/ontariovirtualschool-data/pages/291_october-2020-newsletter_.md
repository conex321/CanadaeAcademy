The struggle to ensure a safe return to class this September has led to a rocky start for families across the province. As we now face the dreaded (but widely anticipated) second wave of COVID-19, many are growing frustrated with the continuing uncertainty surrounding the 2020-2021 academic year.

At OVS, we are fortunate that our pre-existing online model has allowed us to provide consistent, quality service to our student body throughout these challenging times. It is our sincere hope that the quality course content we offer will allow students to maintain their daily learning routine, while providing the added flexibility that is so essential in fostering good mental health. As always, our dedicated instructors and caring student success team are here to support you throughout your studies.

Wishing you continued health and academic success,
The OVS Team
