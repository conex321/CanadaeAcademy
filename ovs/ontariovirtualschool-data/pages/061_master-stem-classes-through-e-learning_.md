The right [online high school](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/) should understand remote learning — and at OVS, we’ve been doing it for over a decade. We’ve got the experience and the technology to provide comprehensive e-Learning programs to students all over Ontario. We offer Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD) high school online courses, and we’re inspected by the Ontario Ministry of Education. Using our e-Learning programs can provide students with the experience and flexibility to tackle high school STEM courses with ease.

## The Benefits of e-Learning

The right [online high school](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/) should understand remote learning — and at OVS, we’ve been doing it for over a decade. We’ve got the experience and the technology to provide comprehensive e-Learning programs to students all over Ontario. We offer Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD) high school online courses, and we’re inspected by the Ontario Ministry of Education. Using our e-Learning programs can provide students with the experience and flexibility to tackle high school STEM courses with ease.

Some students work better with the flexibility that e-learning provides over the one-size-fits-all limitations of traditional day schools.

Perhaps a student has problems with bullying or social anxiety. Perhaps they’re an athlete or even a model and find traditional schooling hard to fit into their schedules. Some students may be aiming at particular college pathways that are poorly served in traditional schooling environments. After the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, a lot of people will continue to explore online learning environments.

Students at the Ontario Virtual School can learn at their own pace, and review difficult topics using our pre-recorded lessons. A course credit can be completed in as little as four weeks, or up to a year, depending on the time they have available.

Grade 12 Advanced Functions ([MHF4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mhf4u/)) and Calculus & Vectors ([MCV4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mcv4u/)) will prepare students for post-secondary study in mathematics, but some students might need a bit more time to tackle the units. While some students have no issue with polynomial and trigonometric functions, others will need extra time — and that’s one of the key benefits of virtual learning.

## The Value of Teachers

One of the big concerns about e-Learning is the lack of direct teacher contact. We understand that and have built our school from the ground up to provide comprehensive teacher support at every stage of the learning process.

If they have any questions, they can ask our experienced Ministry-certified teachers, who are available through email to support their students. Our teachers are also constantly revising and updating the curricula to keep courses relevant and engaging.

We also have an accredited guidance department that aims to keep all students on track, and can also answer questions and concerns not directly related to classes. Our platform has built-in systems that track student activity and will send out notifications to reach out to students if they seem to be behind or are not engaged with our learning platforms. Additionally, we have an extremely fast response time, and assignments and tests are marked and returned to students within just two days.

## Pursuing STEM Courses Easily

For those students aiming to develop their STEM skills, we have some truly amazing tools. One of our greatest is [Gizmos](https://www.explorelearning.com/). Gizmos are interactive math and science simulations. At OVS, we provide access to the largest library of such simulations in the world, with over 400 Gizmos aligned to the latest standards.

This suite of tools is perfect for courses like Grade 11 Functions ([MCR3U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mcr3u/)) or Grade 11 and 12 Physics ([SPH3U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sph3u/)) & ([SPH4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sph4u/)), where students might need a little extra support. Gizmos make geometry, algebra, and electromagnetic radiation exciting with hands-on simulations that break down the core principles clearly and concisely.

There’s a Gizmo for everything, from growth and genetics with the development of digital plants, to exploring the relationship between density, mass, and flotation in a [virtual laboratory](https://www.explorelearning.com/index.cfm?method=cResource.dspDetail&resourceID=362).

Gizmos can teach students how to approach STEM problems, develop and test hypotheses, and learn how to collect and analyze data to support their conclusions. These amazing simulations help our educators bring powerful learning experiences to the virtual classroom. Developed according to the principles of inquiry-based learning that have been supported with [extensive scientific research](https://el-gizmos.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/Why_Gizmos_Work.pdf), Gizmos are an extremely effective way of developing conceptual understanding.

## Developing Soft Skills

Remote study through Ontario Virtual School helps students develop soft skills at every stage of the learning journey. By being self-reliant in the virtual classroom, students take responsibility for their success, a truly important lesson to take into any academic or professional career.

Developing organizational skills and time management is as important in an online environment as it is in a traditional classroom, and our students can take a more active role in tailoring their desired learning pathways. By taking more responsibility for their learning, students are encouraged to set their own goals, and therefore be more engaged with the content they are learning.

Finally, OVS has discussion forums that students are encouraged to use to collaborate with their classmates. Students develop skills in consensus-building, equitable work distribution, and communication skills with their peers. Don’t underestimate these skills: as machine learning and artificial intelligence automate a lot of previously important tasks, the importance of workers with strong soft skills becomes [more valuable, not less](https://trainingindustry.com/articles/e-learning/who-says-e-learning-and-soft-skills-training-dont-mix/).

It’s obvious that e-Learning is helping plug the gaps in Ontario’s education system caused by the COVID pandemic. At OVS, we are ready and able to help students make the most of studying at home. After COVID leaves the headlines, and students return to school, we feel that many will prefer the online environment, as it is better able to accommodate their diverse learning goals, preferences, and abilities.

Whether they’re looking to pick up a few credits or considering a complete change in their education platform, Ontario Virtual School can help students develop the skills they need for success.
