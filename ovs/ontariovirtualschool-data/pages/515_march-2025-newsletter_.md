Our **Vice-Principal Mr. Vinay Aggarwal**, was invited by the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) to attend their Policy Forum on the Occupational Health of Online Teachers. He was one of only a select few to be invited to participate in this conference.

Topics covered in forum included teaching in a digital medium, privacy and work/life balance, understanding and managing occupational risks of at-home work, and dealing with online harassment and social discomfort.

We are incredibly proud that Mr. Aggarwal was invited to participate in this even and provide insight into navigating the world of online education as teacher and administrator.

## OUAC Deadlines

![OUAC Collection Period 3 2025](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/OUAC-Collection-Period-3-1.png)

As we are getting further in to the second semester, it’s important for Grade 12 students to be aware of all deadlines in regards to their university applications.

OUAC Collection Period Three begins on **March 17th** and concludes on **April 24th**. This collection period is for all in progress and midterm grades for second semester.

It is essential to meet this deadline as most university acceptances are determined at the end of this collection period.

In order to make sure students meet this important deadline, the OVS deadline for submitting work is **April 14th.** You must submit all midterm work by this date to ensure that your marks go into OUAC in time.

If work is submitted after this date, it will still be marked, however, we cannot guarantee that your midterm grade will be submitted to [OUAC](https://www.ouac.on.ca/guide/undergrad-dates/) by the deadline.

## OCAS Deadlines

**April 25th 2025 –** deadline for any available marks, regardless of the scheduling model

## Ontario Literacy Test

![Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test Blog Photo Spring Sessions](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/Ontario-Secondary-School-Literacy-Test-Blog-Photo-Spring-Session.png)

The [**Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test**](https://www.eqao.com/the-assessments/osslt/) is a requirement for earning your OSSD. This test is designed to measure whether students are meeting the minimum standard for literacy across all subjects. Generally, this test is administered during the Grade 10 year, but it can be completed at any time during high school.

International or out-of-province students with OVS are eligible to take the OLC4O course, instead of being required to complete the literacy test. However, students based in Ontario are required to complete the test in order to earn their OSSD.

If you are a full-time OVS student based in Ontario, we have a OSSLT test session coming up this spring. The test sessions will run from **March 18th to April 15th 2025.**

Once students have selected a session, they will be asked to pay a $200 fee. This fee covers the testing and includes a teacher-facilitated preparation module with lessons, practice exams from previous years, and more to help students prepare for this mandatory test.

If you have questions regarding the OSSLT requirement, please contact the OVS office at [**[email protected]**](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e687828b8f88a689889287948f89908f949293878a95858e89898ac88587)

Being a high-performance athlete require intense training, focus, and dedication. When you’re still in high school, you also have the added stress of classes, studying, and passing your exams. Doing both can be overwhelming, and often students find themselves either struggling in school or having a hard time maintaining their training for their sport.

[**With OVS**](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), students don’t have to give anything up and can succeed in both their academics and their athletics. Students can customize their education to fit their needs, giving them more freedom to pursue their goals.
