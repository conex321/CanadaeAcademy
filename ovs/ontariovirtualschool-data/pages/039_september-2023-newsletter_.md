We now offer [Social Studies](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/soc6g/) for Grade 6 students. We are also working on developing additional courses for Grade 6 students moving forward.

In Grade 6 social studies, students will explore the experiences and perspectives of diverse communities in historical and contemporary Canada, including First Nations, Métis, Inuit, and settler/newcomer communities, such as the Jewish community. They will examine how these communities have contributed to the development of identities in Canada.

:   Grade 9 De-Streamed Math

As part of an effort to meet the needs of all students and allow them time to develop their knowledge and skills before being required to choose and academic stream, the Ontario Ministry of Education is de-streaming courses for Grade 9 students.

Students will no longer be required to choose between Academic and Applied courses starting from Grade 9, instead taking one general course and choosing levels later on. In previous years, Grade 9 Math and Science have been introduced into Ontario high schools.

This year, English has been officially de-streamed, the new course is now [ENL1W](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng1w/). While the old course codes ENG1P (Applied English) and ENG1D (Academic English) will still be accepted as prerequisites for Grade 10 English, these courses will no longer be offered in Ontario high schools.

## New Courses

[**AVI3M: Grade 11 Visual Art**](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/avi3m/)

This course enables students to further develop their knowledge and skills in visual arts. Students will use the creative process to explore a wide range of themes through studio work that may include drawing, painting, sculpting, and printmaking, as well as the creation of collage, multimedia works, and works using emerging technologies.
