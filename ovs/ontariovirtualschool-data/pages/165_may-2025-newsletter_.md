As we approach the end of the school year, senior students are now starting to make decisions regarding university offers and working towards completing the requirements for their conditional offers of admission. There are essential deadlines all students should be aware of for both university and graduation purposes, which will be covered in this newsletter, as well as helpful study tools and opportunities with OVS.

Now that most students will have received their offers of admission, it is now time to start accepting those offers and making a decision about which school you’d like to attend next year.

**June 2 2025**, is the earliest date a **Group A** applicant may be required to respond to an Ontario university offer.

[Here is a video](https://www.ouac.on.ca/videos/how-to-videos/#respond) with step-by-step instructions for how to respond to an offer of admission.

For more information on accepting offers and other important dates, please check out the [OUAC website.](https://www.ouac.on.ca/guide/undergrad-respond/)

## OUAC Deadlines - Finals

![](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/OUAC-Collection-Period-4.png)

With the midterm deadline passing, it is essential to be aware of the next OUAC deadline dates, so that you can be prepared and plan the remainder of your OVS courses out ahead of time.

The **Opening Date** for OUAC final grades is **June 2nd 2025**.

The **Closing Date** for OUAC final grades is **July 7th 2025**.

To help our students ensure they are meeting these deadlines, OVS has set dates for our students to submit their work by in order to guarantee that their grades make it to OUAC by the final deadlines.

If you are a **Group 1** student, you need to have your work submitted to your teacher by no later than **June 5th 2025.**

If you are a **Group 2** student, you need to have your work submitted to your teacher by no later than **June 25th 2025.**

Please read below to determine which OVS Group you fall into.

![Which Group Am I?](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/Which-Group-Am-I-1024x654.png)

**Group 1** students are those who **need their OVS course to graduate high school** and are **NOT** a ***full-time*** student with OVS. Meaning that if you are attending another Ontario high school full-time and will be graduating from that high school, and not OVS, you are a Group 1 student.

**Group 2** students are students who are **FULL-TIME** with OVS and are earning their OSSD through our school *or*  **DO NOT** need their OVS course to graduate high school (but need the course for OUAC or other purposes).

**Group 1**

Group 1 students must have all work handed in by no later than ***June 5th, 2025. \*\* work will be accepted after this date however we will not be able to guarantee that the mark will be ready in time\*\**** This means that final exams MUST be written on or before this date to have a mark ready in time.

**Group 2**

Group 2 students must have all work handed in by no later than ***June 25th, 2025. \*\* work will be accepted after this date however we will not be able to guarantee that the mark will be ready in time\*\**** This means that final exams MUST be written on or before this date to have a mark ready in time.

Many people, especially many high school students, find themselves wondering a very important question: What is the main difference between college and university? In conversational language, people often use the two terms interchangeably. However, the distinction between the two is very important for anyone planning to attend one.
