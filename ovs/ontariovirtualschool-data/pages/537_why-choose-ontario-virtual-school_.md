Online schooling has been around for years and only continues to rise in popularity as more and more people are drawn to its accessibility and convenience. There are many benefits of online high schools, and if you find yourself contemplating if [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/) is right for you, here are some reasons to attend [OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/).

## Flexible Schedule

Ontario Virtual School is asynchronous, which means that students don’t need to log in at specific times or attend any live lessons. It’s completely up to you when you work on your lessons. Students can work on lessons daily, weekly, or even monthly. This allows students to balance their other commitments with online learning.

## Pacing

OVS is a [self-paced online high school](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), which allows for the flexibility of working through lessons quickly or slowly, whichever may suit your needs.
