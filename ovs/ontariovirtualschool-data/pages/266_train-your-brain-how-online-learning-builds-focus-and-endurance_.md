From ancient classrooms to modern online learning, the impact of education on human growth has always captured our attention. While there are certainly academic benefits of going to school, such as learning content knowledge and skills, there are also a variety of cognitive benefits that come with learning.

## Cognitive Endurance Improves with Practice

It’s not always easy to stay focused and give our full attention to a task at-hand. In a recent study from [*The Quarterly Journal of Economics*](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/140/2/943/7925870), there is evidence to suggest that cognitive endurance has become a form of human capital. What this means is that a student’s ability to engage in and sustain “effortful mental activity over a continuous stretch of time” is a way by which students increase their chances of achieving academic success, both in the classroom and beyond.

## OVS Promotes Cognitive Endurance

Taking online courses at [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/) is a great way for students to develop cognitive endurance. In an age where the ability to concentrate has become more challenging, the design and delivery of [virtual courses](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/) at OVS allow students to practice self-directed learning and develop the valuable skill of cognitive endurance.

## Delivery Model of OVS Courses

One of the greatest features of online learning with OVS is the flexibility it provides in allowing students to customize their schedule to complete any course at their own pace. Students can login to their course and learn at home any time and for any duration. Students are eligible to write the final exam after completing the minimal number of hours. For example: studying a few hours a day will enable students to complete the course in just four weeks. If students require a slower pace, they can take up to 12 months to complete a course. The benefit of this model is that students can use the flexible pacing of courses to increase their cognitive endurance over time.

## OVS Courses Engage Students

Whether it’s [Grade 12 Biology](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sbi4u/) or [Grade 12 Calculus](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mcv4u/), OVS has created a dynamic and interactive multi-media platform for its course delivery. Since this approach is far more engaging than simply just reading text on a screen, students are able to practice and improve their cognitive endurance throughout the duration of a course. The more a student is engaged, the longer they spend time focused on a task. And the longer they spend on a task, their cognitive endurance increases.

## Assessment and Evaluation in OVS Courses

When students are engaged in meaningful and effortful work, assessment and evaluation become opportunities to celebrate a student’s growth and success. OVS believes that a varied assessment and evaluation strategy best allows teachers to gauge their students’ understanding of course content. This means moving away from random computer-generated multiple-choice tests and exams to evaluations that are teacher-driven and tailored to a student’s strength. Completing assessments and evaluations in this way also allow students to further develop their cognitive endurance.

## Develop Your Cognitive Endurance

Taking online courses is a great way for students to practice and develop their cognitive endurance. Since OVS engages students in meaningful and effortful course work, students naturally become more focused over time.

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. **What is cognitive endurance?**Cognitive endurance refers to the ability to stay mentally focused and engaged in effortful thinking over an extended period of time. It’s like building stamina for your brain. The more you practice focusing on challenging tasks, the longer and more effectively you can sustain your attention.

2. **How does taking an online course help improve cognitive endurance?**Online learning encourages self-directed study, time management, and focus without the distractions of a traditional classroom. At [Ontario Virtual School (OVS)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/about-us/), students control their own pace, which allows them to gradually increase the amount of time they spend concentrating on meaningful work, which strengthens their mental endurance over time.

3. **What makes OVS courses different from other online programs?**[OVS courses](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/) are designed with interactive, multimedia lessons that keep students actively engaged in the learning process. Instead of relying solely on static text or auto-graded quizzes, OVS uses teacher-driven assessments and personalized feedback to promote deeper understanding and cognitive growth.

4. **How flexible is the OVS learning model?**Students at OVS can start a course at any time of the year and work at their own pace. Some students complete a course in as little as four weeks, while others take up to 12 months. This flexible pacing helps students manage their workload while building focus and self-discipline, which are essential components of cognitive endurance.

4. **5. How do assessments at OVS support student learning?**OVS teachers use varied forms of assessment that go beyond multiple-choice tests. Projects, written tasks, and application-based evaluations allow students to demonstrate what they’ve learned in meaningful ways, while also developing their ability to focus and sustain effort over longer periods.
