As a concept, we understand procrastination. It is the putting off until tomorrow mentality that takes over when we believe that further along our current path is something we don’t want to confront or do. What we need to do is determine the reason behind our individual decision to procrastinate.

For some, it is a fear of reaching the finish line; for others, it can be chalked up to a lack of motivation. Still others procrastinate as a result of self-doubt: they don’t believe in their ability to complete the task at hand, or don’t see themselves as worthy of doing, believing it a task better suited to someone else.

Ultimately, whatever the reason, procrastination always results in the same thing. Task A remains unfinished. Typically, Task B will the pile on top of Task A, and so on and so forth, until feelings of anxiety or panic set in and force our hand. But why wait for this negativity to spur you onwards? How can we take charge of our tendency to procrastinate and squash it before it kicks in?

The first step is to understand why you procrastinate. Some good old-fashioned self-reflection should accomplish this easily enough.

The next step is to take that reason (or reasons – you may have different ones for different tasks), and come up with a workable plan of action to resolve the root cause. For example, if you don’t want to complete something (say, your high school diploma) for fear of what comes next (the real world – eek!), do some research and find a path that doesn’t scare you and work forward from there. If the cause is self-doubt, reassure yourself that you can do this – you wouldn’t have been asked to do this task if someone out there didn’t believe you could do it. And, if you start and begin to struggle, know there is no shame in asking for help – even belatedly!

All too often, the easiest solution to procrastination comes down to a shift in attitude. Try to see the task – and completing it – from a different, more positive, perspective and see what happens!
