# The Courage to Learn: Taking Ownership of Your Education - Ontario Virtual School

**Source:** https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/the-courage-to-learn-taking-ownership-of-your-education
**Description:** It’s no secret that each of us has our individual preferences when it comes to learning. For this reason, the traditional classroom doesn’t always meet the needs of all learners. Whether it has to do with the structure of a traditional school day, the time allotted to each subject or course, or the pacing of the material, there is no doubt that traditional education leaves little room for individualized learning pathways.  With OVS, students can learn online in a flexible environment that suites their needs.

In an age where the phrase “you do you” seems to permeate every area of contemporary life, why not apply it to the world of education?

It’s no secret that each of us has our individual preferences when it comes to learning. For this reason, the traditional classroom doesn’t always meet the needs of all learners. Whether it has to do with the structure of a traditional school day, the time allotted to each subject or course, or the pacing of the material, there is no doubt that traditional education leaves little room for individualized learning pathways.

## What is Online Asynchronous Learning?

One of the ways in which students can take greater ownership of their education is through online asynchronous learning. As defined by the [Ontario Ministry of Education](https://www.ontario.ca/document/education-ontario-policy-and-program-direction/policyprogram-memorandum-164), online asynchronous learning refers to “learning that is not delivered in real time” and could include activities such as watching pre-recorded videos, completing assigned tasks or contributing to online discussion boards.

## What are the Benefits?

As highlighted by various education institutions, such as the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/keep-learning/strategies-remote-teaching/synchronous-vs-asynchronous-online-learning) in Ontario, Canada, there are many advantages to online asynchronous learning. The greatest advantage is that students can essentially complete a course on their own schedule! They can create their own timetable, access and process material at their own pace, and ultimately take as much (or as little) time as students need to complete the course work. In contrast to the strict timelines often associated with traditional learning, asynchronous online learning offers unparalleled freedom and flexibility.

## Online Asynchronous Learning: A Growing Trend

As highlighted in a [journal article](https://journals.uj.ac.za/SOTL/index.php/sotls/article/view/322/169) dedicated to the scholarship of teaching and learning in the ‘global South’, there has been an educational paradigm shift over the past 15-20 years in terms of mode of learning and location. It comes as no surprise then that online asynchronous learning is a [growing trend](https://edtechmagazine.com/k12/article/2021/09/asynchronous-learning-gains-popularity-following-pandemic-education-adjustments). Initially thought to be a short-term response to the Covid-19 pandemic, asynchronous learning is now here for the long-term. What is more, many online schools have also found that students have [higher student engagement](https://edtechmagazine.com/k12/article/2021/09/asynchronous-learning-gains-popularity-following-pandemic-education-adjustments) in such online courses.

## Online Asynchronous Learning at Ontario Virtual School

Students who are enrolled in Ontario Virtual School online courses have the benefit of capitalizing on this growing trend. Some students at OVS are engaging in [hybrid learning](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/benefits-to-hybrid-online-learning/), in which students still attend a traditional school for some courses and enroll in virtual school with OVS for other courses. Other students, such as [student athletes](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/balancing-academics-and-athletics/), might decide to take all of their credits online while travelling and practicing so that they can manage their time more effectively. Whether you’re looking to complete a compulsory credit for the Ontario high school diploma requirements such as [Grade 12 English](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/ENG4U/) or an elective credit such as [Gr. 12 Canadian and International Law](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/cln4u/), the possibilities and combinations are endless!

It sometimes takes courage to try something new and to make decisions that are right for you and your learning pathway. If you’re thinking it’s time to take advantage of flexible learning timelines and the freedom to learn on your own terms, then feel free to reach out to an [OVS Guidance Counsellor](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/guidance/) today to see how you can take ownership of your learning.
