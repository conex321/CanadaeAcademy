Since the advent of online learning, there have been a variety of different students who have leveraged the benefits of a non-traditional classroom. Whether students cannot attend classes on a regular basis due to personal or health-related reasons, athletic commitments,  full-time jobs or accessibility reasons, the online world of learning has opened up alternative options for today’s diverse learners.

## Online Learning with Ontario Virtual School

As a [French](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/french-immersion/) teacher with [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/about-us/), I have had the privilege of instructing students from all different parts of the world and who are each on their own learning journey. I have a great deal of admiration for these students, as they have taken ownership of their learning pathway. Whether it’s taking a full courseload with OVS, such as their [entire Grade 12 year](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/grade-12/), or just specific credits, such as [Gr. 12 English](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4u/) or [Gr. 12 Functions](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mhf4u/) online, these students have discovered how to make learning work for them without sacrificing other areas of their lives.

## The Love of Learning Online

I recently had one of my students reach out to me to express their excitement to begin [FSF1D](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/fsf1d/) and to add it to their repertoire of online learning courses. This student explained to me that once they switched to online learning during the pandemic, they couldn’t imagine returning to a traditional classroom or dayschool. They fell in love with online learning and they’ve never looked back!

## Benefits of Online Learning

During my email interactions with the student, they identified some key advantages to pursuing online school vs. traditional school:

* OVS has [no deadlines](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/learnathome/); this student appreciates how they can finish a course in as quickly as 4 weeks or take a slower pace and finish it in up to 12 months
* The ability to take tests and [complete assignments online](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/online-school/) – compared to in-person –  has significantly reduced this student’s stress and improved mental health
* Without bell times or periods, there is a great deal of flexibility. This student lives on a farm and is able to complete daily chores and learn the [value of agriculture](https://www.cfa-fca.ca/), while still completing course work
* The ability to dedicate full days to certain courses has helped the student stay organized. For example, they like to do [Math](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mth1w/) on Mondays and [French](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/fsf1d/) on Tuesdays.
* [Movement](https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/catalogs/tip-sheets/integrating-movement-breaks-your-class) is an important part of overall health learning. This student enjoys the option of going on a walk or playing a sport in between working on courses.
* There’s something to be said for being [comfortable while learning](https://www.westcountrygroup.com/education/how-does-physical-comfort-affect-learning#:~:text=With%20less%20oxygen%20reaching%20the,and%20reduced%20participation%20in%20lessons.). This student enjoys being in the comfort of their own home, in a comfortable chair and workspace.
* [Time on task](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00131911.2024.2438878#abstract) is a key component to learning effectively. This student appreciates not being distracted by nearby un-motivated students.
* Asynchronous learning allows for other skills to be honed. This student loves to play the piano and is very [passionate about music](https://www.edutopia.org/article/how-music-primes-brain-learning/).
