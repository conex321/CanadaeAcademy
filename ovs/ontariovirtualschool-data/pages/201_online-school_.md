Since 2010, Ontario Virtual School (OVS) has operated as an accredited online school in Ontario. Since then, our enrollment population has grown to 30,000.

OVS provides a rich variety of online learning and has been inspected by the Ontario Ministry of Education. We provide a wide variety of online virtual high school OSSD credit courses, which lead to an Ontario Secondary School Diploma(OSSD).

Our students register for all kinds of reasons. Some are looking to add new courses in addition to their current work, while others are looking to upgrade existing marks.

We also support mature students, international students, and people who need to schedule schoolwork around other commitments. Our students also include elite athletes and professional models.

### Part-time Learning: Online High School Ontario

Students can register for an online course any time of year. Courses can be completed in as little as 4 weeks, or take up to 12 months. Students have 24/7 access to our online course content, so they can learn at their own pace. All learning materials and textbooks are included in the course fees.

OVS helps students achieve their highest academic potential at a pace and timing that best supports their personal learning style. We recognize that every student learns in his or her own way. We understand the importance of secondary education and offer students an alternative, accessible means of achieving their diploma.

Ontario Virtual School believes good teaching fosters effective learning. We are committed to this philosophy and only employ certified, experienced Ontario teachers.

Our teachers are proud to support learners in a variety of ways, including:

* Email support
* Fair and varied assessments
* Timely feedback
* Mark updates on evaluations
* Ensuring students grades reflect their most consistent level of achievement

## How Does it Work?

Students may choose their start date on any day of the year. They gain access to courses immediately after signing up.

This model allows students to work at their own pace and on their own schedule with the support of qualified teachers. Here’s how it works:

### 1. Register

### 2. Access Online Course

* OVS lessons are fully animated, narrated, and interactive online videos
* Courses are accessible online 24/7, 365 days a year from anywhere in the world

### 3. Complete Final Summative/Proctored Exam

* Students download course work (tests and assignments). The student must then upload them to the dropbox.
* Students and parents receive on-going feedback and mark updates by email.

### 4. Complete Final Summative/Proctored Exam

* A proctor is required for courses with final exams (a professional, such as a librarian, engineer, or teacher to supervise during the exam).
* International students may use proctors in their own country.

### 5. Receive Final Report Card

* A copy of the final report card is mailed to the student and their home school. At the student’s request, the report card can be mailed to post-secondary institutions.

## Ontario Virtual School and Homeschooling

OVS makes it easy for homeschoolers to complete their home-based education. Ontario Virtual School works closely with the homeschooler’s parents to meet their child’s educational goals.

> OVS was the best choice for us! They helped my son and daughter to attain marks required for the university admission. We had experience with the grade 12 biology, chemistry, and math teachers who were highly supportive, considerate, flexible, and accommodating. They put their best effort to help kids attain their goals by keeping them motivated and responding quickly to their emails. The admin staff is very polite, knowledgeable and guide you on the right track. We highly recommend OVS to those looking to earn online credits.
