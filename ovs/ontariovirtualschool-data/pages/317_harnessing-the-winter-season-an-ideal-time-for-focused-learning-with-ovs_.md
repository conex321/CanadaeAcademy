            If you’re lucky to live in a part of the world where you can experience all 4 seasons, the chances of choosing winter as a favourite season might be low. Apart from the obvious winter characteristics of cold weather, heavy snow and shorter daylight, some less obvious characteristics of winter might include a desire to slow down and withdraw from the clamor of the outside world.

**Hygge in the Winter**

            A state of mind that is closely related to this desire is something the Danish culture refers to as “[hygge](https://www.brownhealth.org/be-well/embrace-hygge-and-learn-love-winter)”. While the translation of this word is sometimes difficult to capture, [Brown University Health](https://www.brownhealth.org/be-well/embrace-hygge-and-learn-love-winter) has described it as a sense of well-being and contentment that comes with “embracing the season…and finding comfort in coziness”. As such, it encourages people to take advantage of this time of year and to capitalize on what it has to offer.

**Harnessing the Winter Season with Ontario Virtual School**

A great way to embrace the season of slowing down and staying home is by taking a virtual online high school course with [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/about-us/). As an [accredited online school](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/private-school-contact-information) in Ontario, students are able to choose from a [variety of online courses](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/) that will count towards their Ontario Secondary School Diploma ([OSSD](https://www.ontario.ca/page/earning-your-high-school-diploma)). Whether it’s taking a [Gr. 11 or 12 upgrade course](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/upgrade-courses/) such as Gr. 12 English [ENG4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4u-upgrade/) or taking a compulsory course for graduation such as Gr. 9 French ([FSF1D](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/fsf1d/)), the ability to complete these courses from the comfort of your home is priceless.

**How to Hygge with Online Learning**

            Although the concept of *hygge* is of Danish origin, there is no doubt that this state of mind resonates with Canadians as well.
