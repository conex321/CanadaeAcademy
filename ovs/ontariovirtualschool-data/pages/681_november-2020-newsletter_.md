**NEW TEACHER SPOTLIGHT: MEET MS. PE**

Hi, my name is Ms. Pe and I’m a new teacher with OVS!

Outside of teaching, I love to travel and explore new places, as well as experience different cuisines from all over the world. I love to cook and bake, and it would be my ultimate dream to travel and stay in different places while learning the region’s culinary arts.

**Ms. Pe is currently accepting new students for BOH4M.**
