**Description:** As we are almost midway through the summer, many students are already starting to prepare for the post-secondary program, or for the start of a new school year. For these students, there is still time to fit in a summer school course either to get ahead for the next school year, or to ensure that they can attend their post-secondary programs this fall.

As we are almost midway through the summer, many students are already starting to prepare for the post-secondary program, or for the start of a new school year. For these students, there is still time to fit in a summer school course either to get ahead for the next school year, or to ensure that they can attend their post-secondary programs this fall.

## University Offers

![Ontario University Offer Header](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/Ontario-University-Offer-Header.png)

Are you a recent graduate but you unfortunately didn’t receive an offer for the university you applied to? Or did you not apply to university for September but have now changed your mind and are looking for still open programs?

Don’t worry, it’s not too late! There are still many open programs that you can apply to in order to attend university in the fall or winter.

OVS can help you find open programs at a wide variety of schools. Make an appointment with one of our qualified counsellors to discuss your options!

## Meeting Conditional Offers

Did you receive a conditional offer for a university program but have unfortunately not met the requirement with your grades? Don’t panic, there is still time to meet your requirements.

Most university programs allow students to take summer courses to try and improve their marks and meet the requirements ahead of fall enrollment. For most universities, they require students to have completed their summer course on or around August 15th, but it does vary school to school, so make sure to check in with your university about their deadlines.

Now, if it’s the overall Grade Point Average that has fallen short of your university offer, you have a couple of options. You can retake a course you’ve already completed as an Upgrade Course. Alternatively, you can take a new course to try and boost your grade.

Here are some easy courses we recommend that are helpful grade boosters:

## Grade 12 Nutrition and Health

[HFA4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/hfa4u/) explores the relationships between food, energy balance, and nutritional status; our nutritional needs at different stages of life; and the role of nutrition in health and disease. Throughout this course, students will evaluate nutrition-related trends and examine how food choices can promote food security and environmental responsibility. They will also learn about healthy eating, expand their repertoire of food-preparation techniques, and develop their social science research skills by investigating issues related to nutrition and health.

## Grade 12 Indigenous Issues

In this [Grade 12 Indigenous Studies (NDW4M)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/ndw4m/) course, students will examine global issues from the perspectives of Indigenous peoples, investigating topics such as identity, social justice, human rights, spirituality, resilience, and advocacy for change. Students will draw on the depth and diversity of Indigenous cultures, traditions, and knowledge to consider how Indigenous communities around the world persevere despite current global political, social, and economic challenges.

## Upgrading Courses

![Upgrade Courses](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/Upgrade-in-3-weeks-e1678394431390.jpg)

Alternatively, if you got a lower mark in one of your required subjects for your university acceptance, you can take an Upgrade Course with OVS, and complete it quickly, to try and pull your mark up.

In an Upgrade course, all of the course material is available to you. However, you’re not required to watch all of the lessons, and depending on the course, you can hand in fewer assessments. For example, many of our Upgrade science courses make it so that lab assignments are optional, meaning you just need to complete the Unit Tests and Exams, and only do the labs if you want to attempt to raise your overall mark. You can move through an Upgrade course quickly, complete it in 21 days.

Some common Upgrade courses students take with us are: [Grade 12 English](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4u-upgrade/) (ENG4U) , [Grade 12 Advanced Functions](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mhf4u-upgrade/) (MHF4U), [Grade 12 Chemistry](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sch4u-upgrade/) (SCH4U) and[,](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sch4u-upgrade/)[Grade 12 Biology](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sbi4u-upgrade/) (SBI4U).

If you’ve met all of your university requirements but want to do a little something over the summer to both help you prepare for university and keep you actively engaged in school and learning, then you can also take our free, non-credit course, [OVS5O University Writing Preparation](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/free-courses/grade-12-university-writing-preparation/).

Regardless of your course program, university requires a lot of communication skill and writing. With this course, you’ll learn writing skills centre around the kind of assignments you’ll encounter in university, including essay writing and research papers.
