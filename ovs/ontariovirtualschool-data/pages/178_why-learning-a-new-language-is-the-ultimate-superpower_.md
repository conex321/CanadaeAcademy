# **Why Learning a New Language is the Ultimate Superpower**

## **The benefits of learning a new language**

There were so many times I wanted to quit learning a second language. I wasn’t living in an environment that spoke the language, and it felt like nothing was sticking. But today, I speak the language with fluency and that skill has opened more doors than I could have imagined.

My language journey helped me professionally, but more importantly, it helped me grow as a person. Recognizing these benefits can be inspiring, and can ensure you are not closing doors that can lead you to a better you! At [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), [we believe in empowering students through learning](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/about-us/) – and that includes language learning. So before you decide to close the door on studying a new language, take a moment to consider the lifelong benefit it offers. Your future self will thank you

### **1. It is empowering**

Learning a language isn’t easy, but that’s what makes it so powerful. Every time you struggle through a conversation or grasp a new word, you’re proving to yourself that you’re capable of growth. When you finally find yourself speaking comfortably, the pride you feel is unmatched.

### **2. It improves cultural understanding**

Have you ever logged onto Netflix, found a really great movie, but realized it’s in a language you don’t know? [Media is one of the most powerful ways to experience and access different cultures in the modern world](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ontario-virtual-school-on-tiktok/), especially when it presents stories directly from the perspective of that culture. Beyond media, many words and concepts in other languages don’t have direct translations, offering unique windows into cultural values and traditions. For example, the Japanese term “yūgen” describes [“a](https://www.ef.com/wwen/blog/language/14-more-japanese-words-with-no-english-translations/) [profound, mysterious sense of the beauty of the universe…and the sad beauty of human suffering” (Martinique, n.d)](https://www.ef.com/wwen/blog/language/14-more-japanese-words-with-no-english-translations/). Learning such terms gives you deeper insight into how people in different cultures view life and the world around them. This cultural understanding helps break down stereotypes and promotes respect for diverse customs and behaviors.

### **3. It decreases bias in decision making**

The term, “foreign language effect” refers to the theory that your decisions differ when making them in your native language. Why might this be? Well:

1. You are more biased when using your native language
2. You experience less emotional arousal when using a foreign language (leading to more rational choices)

[Your native language is deeply connected to your history and cultural context (Jiao et. Al, 2025).](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/13670050.2024.2445260?needAccess=true) Using a foreign language can reduce impulse decisions driven by emotions. That said, emotions are important and they serve a purpose, so they should still be considered! It is still helpful to be aware of this effect and learn to use it in balance to your (and others’) advantage.

### **4. It promotes and enhances executive functioning**

Think of executive functioning as a toolbox that helps you manage everyday tasks (learn more about this topic in [HSP3U: Introduction to Psychology, Anthropology and Sociology](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/hsp3u/)). The three main skills that it provides you with are:

1. Working memory: How you make sense of new information and apply it
2. Cognitive flexibility: Your ability to adapt to change (and multi-task)
3. Inhibition control: Your ability to regulate your reactions

(Cleveland Clinic, 2024)

Now what if we told you that you can improve your mental toolbox? Who wouldn’t want to strengthen skills that will help them navigate daily life? Learning a second language has been shown in some studies to boost executive functioning skills. Even better, this relationship is reciprocal, so not only will learning a new language increase executive functioning, but as your executive function increases, it will help you learn a new language (Han Li, n.d).

### **5. It increases social connections**

Over 1.52 billion people speak the language that I am writing this in. There are about 8 billion people in the world. Imagine how many new people you could connect with and the communities you could join by learning a new language. Learning a new language opens the door to hearing other people’s stories and broadens your horizons.

At [OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), we are passionate about [travel and international connections](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/international-students/). Our school community is filled with learners and educators from around the globe, so the language skills you build here will help you connect with classmates and form friendships that cross borders.

Beyond that, learning a new language is a great conversation starter! Tell people about your language learning journey and teach them a word you learned. Plus, with the empowerment and confidence you gain, you will feel more confident approaching new people to spark connections with!
