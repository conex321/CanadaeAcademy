Scarlett is a current Grade 11 student with OVS, enrolled in Math ([MCR3U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mcr3u/)), Physics ([SPH3U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sph3u/)) and English ([ENG3U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng3u/)).

Originally from Montreal, Canada, her family moved to Jamaica when she was 8 years old. Scarlett is an equestrian, who has twice won the Grand Caraibe in Martinique for Jamaica (a horse jumping competition). She has also participated in competitions in Suriname, Ireland, Guadeloupe and Colombia.

Scarlett decided to become a full-time student with OVS during Covid-19, because online school in Jamaica wasn’t put together well.

Another contributing factor to her decision to join OVS was the flexibility and freedom that most school don’t provide. With more time for her athletics, she has been able to represent Jamaica as a horse back rider in showjumping in several different countries.

We asked Scarlett a few questions about her experience with OVS:

## How has OVS prepared you for post-secondary?

A lot of schools, your parents make sure you go to class and there’s a set timetable, but with OVS there isn’t any set timetable, or set classes so we need to have good time-management skills, dedication, self-motivation, and consistency.

When we go to college/university we won’t have a period of adjustment like other students. We’ll be used to not having someone make us go to class and we’ll be able to manage our time well. OVS also is online so sometimes we have to help ourselves a little bit and teach ourselves, so we won’t have trouble when we are in a huge classroom where the teacher won’t have time to slow down and help each and every one of us.

## What advice would you share with students looking to take courses online?

I would tell them to keep having social interactions and not just disappear. It can be hard to keep socializing when you are in online school, but it is so important to keep being social.

## How did your experience taking courses with OVS compare to your day school?

There are pros and cons to both like most things in life. I miss the social aspect of day school and the interactions and help I got from teachers in person, but OVS has taught me a lot and has ultimately let me live the life I wanted to live.

Scarlett is continuing to work through her Grade 11 year with OVS and is making great strides towards her OSSD with us.

We hope to continue to support Scarlett in her education, while allowing her the freedom to pursue her other interests.
