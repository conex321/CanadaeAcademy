Thinking about upgrading high school course marks or fast-tracking your high school education? Many students avoid summer courses, assuming they’ll lose their well-earned break. But here’s the truth: summer learning and summer fun can go hand in hand! In fact, taking a summer school course can provide you with peace of mind, knowing that you are setting yourself up for future success!

Before you rule out summer school, let’s bust a few common myths that stop students from getting ahead. Our goal at [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/) is to provide you with the curriculum you need to succeed, with the clarity and confidence to take control of your learning.

## Myth #1: You Can’t Travel or see Friends and Take Courses

Do you think summer school means saying goodbye to vacation or time with friends? Not at [OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/)! [Our courses are fully online and accessible from anywhere in the world](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), allowing you to keep learning without pressing pause on summer fun. In fact, that is just an advantage of virtual learning all year round.

At [OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), we believe in balance. Whether you’re studying by the pool, on a family trip, or in another country, you can work through your lessons on your schedule and log off when it’s time to explore! Summer learning doesn’t mean missing out- it means making the most of your summer, wherever you are.

## Myth #2: Summer School Courses Are Too Fast-Paced and Overwhelming

While some public summer school programs limit students to just the month of July, [OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/) offers unmatched flexibility. You can [complete your course in as little as 21 days – or take up to a full year](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/faq/), depending on your needs. This is especially helpful for students who realize they need another course, such as [ENG4U (Grade 12 English)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4u/) to meet university requirements

With course materials available 24/7 for the duration of the course, study at your own pace and revisit lessons as often as needed. We offer content in multiple formats (text, visuals, videos, etc.), so no matter how you learn best, the material can be tailored to your needs ([check out our SBI4U: Grade 12 Biology demo lesson here to learn more](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sbi4u/#iframe_container)).

## Myth #3: Summer School is Only for Students Who Failed Courses

At [OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), our students come from all over the world and represent a wide range of ages and goals. Whether you’re looking to get ahead, lighten next year’s course load, or explore a subject of interest, summer school can be a strategic choice, not just a fallback. [Oxford University states that summer learning should be part of every student’s life](https://oxfordlearning.com/10-benefits-of-summer-learning/) (Oxford Learning, 2022). Studies show that “students’ achievement scores declined over summer vacation by one month’s worth of school-year learning” (Quinn & Polikoff, 2017). So keep your brain learning with [SPH4U (Grade 12 Physics)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sph4u/) or [BBM4M (Grade 12 International Business Foundations)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/bbb4m/) this summer.

[We organize our courses into student goals so you can see how you are in fact planning for success](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/online-summer-school-courses/)! Check out the goals here:

## Myth #4: Online Summer Courses Don’t Offer Teacher Support

At [OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), our mission is to [“empower all learners through the use of technology so they can experience academic success.”](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/about-us/) When choosing educators, this vision is at the forefront of mind. Our educators are part of our community because they share the goal of creating a student centred education system where all students can succeed. Our teacher supports are not just policy, they are passion driven relationships built on our shared vision. Students in our courses will receive responses to emails within 1 business day and feedback returned within 2 business days. Our support is tailored to student needs, and aims to equip them with the skills they will require within the course, and beyond.

Summer school can be a powerful way to take charge of your future, build time management skills, and learn the importance of balance – all while enjoying your well-deserved break. At [OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), [our 200+ dedicated staff](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/meet-our-staff/) are here to support your success. Put the myths to rest, and enjoy the peace of mind that comes from starting the school year ahead.
