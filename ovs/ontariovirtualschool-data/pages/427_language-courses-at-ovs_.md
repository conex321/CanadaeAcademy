# Language Courses at OVS - Ontario Virtual School

**Source:** https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/language-courses-at-ovs
**Description:** Did you know - that according to UNESCO - there are more than 7000 languages spoken around the world today? With this increased diversity in the linguistic landscape, the need for cross-cultural understanding is more important than ever. While learning an additional language is not a new concept, there is now an increased benefit to learning a new language, as it provides the skills needed to build peace, tolerance and respect for differences both within and outside of the classroom.
