## Course Description For SNC2D Grade 10 Science Online Course

Grade 10 Science allows students to enhance their understanding of basic concepts in biology, chemistry, earth and space science, and physics, and relates these areas of study to technology, society, and the environment. Throughout this course, students will further develop their skills in planning and conducting scientific investigations. Through the various units of this course, students will seek to deepen their understanding of scientific theories as they relate to: the interaction of light and matter; the forces that affect climate and climate change; the chemical reactions of acids and bases, and the connections between cells and systems in both animals and plants.

Please note, as per Ministry guidelines, OVS has a mandatory 14 day minimum requirement for student enrollment to be eligible for a midterm report card and 28 days enrollment to be eligible for a final report card.

## Fundamental Concepts Covered in Grade 10 Science Online Course

This course is designed to provide students with the necessary skills and knowledge as well as a development of an attitude that supports these skills and knowledge responsibly. The course design is geared to meet and exceed the prerequisite requirements for studying science at an academic level. The framework of course delivery focuses the “big ideas” through the lens of the three goals of the science program as outlined on page 4 of the Ontario Ministry of Education document: (1) To relate science to technology, society, and the environment (2) To develop the skills, strategies, and habits of mind required for scientific inquiry (3) To understand the basic concepts of science. The organization of the course is packaged into four distinct units which correspond directly with the Ontario Curriculum, Grades 9 and 10 Science document. In addition, a pre-unit has been added to review and assess the knowledge and skills of students prior to commencing the actual grade 10 course material. As outlined in Growing Success, 2010, teachers will provide an assessment for learning task at the beginning of the course; after the pre-unit. Teachers will be able to use the results of this diagnostic to identify gaps in concepts for learners and provide opportunities to bridge these gaps preparing all learners to be successful in the Grade 10 academic science course by establishing a strong prerequisite foundation.

## Online Teaching and Learning Strategies

Teachers will bring enthusiasm and varied teaching and assessment approaches to the classroom, addressing individual students’ needs and ensuring sound learning opportunities for every student. The activities offered should enable students to relate and apply these concepts to the social, environmental, and economical conditions and concerns of the world in which they live. Opportunities to relate knowledge and skills to these wider contexts will motivate students to learn in a meaningful way and to become life-long learners. Teachers will help students understand that problem solving of any kind often requires a considerable expenditure of time and energy and a good deal of perseverance. Teachers also will encourage students to investigate, to reason, to explore alternative solutions and to take the risks necessary to become successful problem solvers. Effective instructional approaches and learning activities draw on students’ prior knowledge, capture their interest, and encourage meaningful practise both inside and outside the classroom. Students will be engaged when they are able to see the connection between the scientific concepts they are learning and their application in the world around them and in real-life situations. Due to its importance, students will have opportunities to learn in a variety of ways- individually, cooperatively, independently, with teacher direction, through hands-on experiences, and through examples followed by practice. The approaches and strategies teachers use will vary according to both the object of the learning and the needs of the students. Teachers will accomplish this in online environment with the use of: virtual labs, online simulations, animations, videos, discussion forums, live chat and other interactive objects.

## Assessment & Evaluation

As summarized in [Growing Success 2010](http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/success.html), the primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning. Information gathered through assessment helps teachers to determine students’ strengths and weaknesses and adapt curriculum and instructional approaches accordingly.

As part of assessment, teachers provide students with descriptive feedback to help guide their learning Evaluation refers to the process of measuring the quality of work against an established criteria, and assigning a value representative of work quality. All curriculum expectations must be accounted for in instruction, but evaluation focuses on students’ achievement of the overall expectations.

A students’ achievement is evaluated in relation to specific expectations. Teachers use their professional judgement to determine which specific expectations should be used to evaluate achievement of overall expectations, and which ones will be covered in instruction and assessment but not used as an evaluation benchmark. To ensure assessment and evaluation are valid and fair teachers use assessment and evaluation strategies that:

* Address both what students learn and how well they learn
* Are based on the achievement level descriptions given in the achievement chart
* Are varied in nature, administered over time, and designed to provide opportunities for students to demonstrate the full range of their learning
* Are appropriate for the learning activities used, the purposes of instruction, and the needs and experiences of the students
* Are fair to all students
* Accommodate students with special education needs, consistent with the strategies outlined in their Individual Education Plan
* Accommodate the needs of students who are learning the language of instruction
* Ensure that each student is given clear directions for improvement
* Promote students’ ability to assess their own learning and to set specific goals
* Include student work samples as evidence their achievement
* Are communicated clearly to students and parents at the beginning of the school year and at other appropriate points throughout the school year.

The achievement chart outlines four categories of knowledge and skills:

1. Knowledge and understanding
2. Critical thinking
3. Communication
4. Application

Teachers assess and/or evaluate work in a balanced manner with respect to the four categories. A final grade is recorded, and a credit is granted and recorded for this course if the student’s grade is 50% or higher. The final grade for this course will be determined as follows:

**Seventy percent of the grade** is based on evaluations conducted throughout the course. This portion of the grade reflects the student’s most consistent level of achievement throughout the course, although special consideration should be given to more recent evidence of achievement.

**Thirty percent of the grade** is based on a final evaluation and administered towards the end of the course.

## Special Accommodations for Students with an IEP

Every single student is capable of success. Some students are able, with certain [accommodations](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/iep-accommodations/), to participate in the regular course curriculum and demonstrate independent learning.

[Accommodations](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/iep-accommodations/) allow access to the course without any changes to the [knowledge and skills the student is expected to demonstrate](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/assessment-evaluation/). The accommodations required to facilitate the student’s learning are identified by the teacher. Recommendations from a School Board generated [Individual Education Plan (IEP)](https://www.specialeducationguide.com/pre-k-12/individualized-education-programs-iep/the-iep-process-explained/) if available can also be consulted. Instruction based on principles of universal design and differentiated make it possible to meet the diverse needs of all learners.

**Examples of accommodations (but not limited to) include:**

* Adjusting or extending assessment deadlines
* Providing alternative assignments or summative tasks
* Use of scribes and/or other assistive technologies
* Simplifying the language of instruction
