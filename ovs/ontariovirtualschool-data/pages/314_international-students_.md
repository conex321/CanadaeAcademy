Testimonial of A Successful OVS Student from India

My first choice was to do my undergraduate study in Canada; in grade 12 I was studying in Punjab, India in the C.B.S.E Board’s medical stream. When I realized that I have to complete a grade 12 math course in order to receive admission in a B.Sc. program at a Canadian university. This was a difficult predicament for me, either I had to study one more year to complete the Grade 12 math course or I had to forget about studying at a Canadian university. Then one of the university advisers showed me the path; Ontario Virtual School. Now, I have completed my Math requirements through Ontario Virtual School. In the end, I was accepted to all of the universities I applied to in Ontario in same year. – Manreet Singh Boparai
