> The Ontario Virtual School thoroughly exceeded my expectations. The online course including videos, explanations and assignments were organized and well prepared. My experience with the teacher and staff were also exceptional - the support I received was immediate and outstanding. I would recommend OVS to anyone looking to complete a high school course online.
