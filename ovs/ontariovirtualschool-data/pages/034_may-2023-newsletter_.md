**Description:** Though we have just passed the midterm deadlines, senior students already need to start planning for graduation. Many students will be getting their conditional offers over the next month for their post-secondary programs, but just because you receive an offer doesn’t mean that you can stop focusing on your school work. You’ll see need to maintain your grades and graduate on time to keep your offers.

## Graduation

Though we have just passed the midterm deadlines, senior students already need to start planning for graduation. Many students will be getting their conditional offers over the next month for their post-secondary programs, but just because you receive an offer doesn’t mean that you can stop focusing on your school work. You’ll see need to maintain your grades and graduate on time to keep your offers.

For OVS students, there are certain deadlines you’ll need to meet in order to guarantee getting you grades where they need to go. For this purpose, we have broken up our students into three groups.

**Group 1**: Students enrolled full-time in a day school who are graduating this June, taking courses at OVS that are **needed to meet graduation requirements**. (I.E One of your 30 credits)

**Group 2**: Students graduating with OVS **OR**students enrolled in a full-time day school who **DO NOT**need their OVS credits for graduation and **only** need their OVS course marks sent to OUAC/OCAS (I.E Upgrade course students)

**Group 3**: Neither of the above; not graduating from an Ontario High School this year **and/or** not applying to post-secondary for September 2022 (I.E Grades 9-11 students, 105 applicants)

Once you know which group you fall under there are deadlines that you’ll need to be aware of:
