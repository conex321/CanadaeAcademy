As one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, English proficiency is critical for success in the fields of international business, academia, and so many others! That is just one reason why Zuhal Athar decided to use the extra time afforded to her from the COVID-19 pandemic to learn English. Zuhal lives in Afghanistan, and while there are schools that teach English as a second language there, Zuhal decided to study English as a Second Language with [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/). ![](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/Afghanistan-Map-300x218.jpg) With OVS, not only could Zuhal take [all 5 levels of ESL](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/esl/) designed and administered in a country where English is the primary language, but thanks to [OVS’s fully online format](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/about-us/), she could study from the comfort of her own home! We asked Zuhal a few questions about her experience with OVS, and she was kind enough to give us the following responses, which we would like to share with you here:

###### What are you currently studying?

I am studying [ESLEO](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/esleo/) at OVS right now and am enjoying taking the lessons and doing the activities. The main reason that I enjoy studying ESLEO is that it provokes my thinking abilities and creativity at the same time.

###### What courses have you taken with OVS?

I started with ESLAO and enjoyed it so much I progressed through each of the levels ([ESLBO](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eslbo/), [ESLCO](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eslco/), [ESLDO](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/esldo/)) and I am now completing the last one now, ESLEO. I also took Grade 9 Mathematics as a review.

###### Why did you decide to enroll with OVS?

A family member suggested it. When I took the first course, I found OVS effective, and I continued my other courses at OVS also. I really enjoyed them: it was entertaining, beside the fact that I learned something from it.

###### What have been some of your favourite parts of online learning so far?

It was the entertaining videos and readings, as well as some activities which encouraged me to be so creative in learning the English language.

###### How does your experience with OVS differ from your experience with your day school?

I don’t see many differences between OVS and a day school regarding the teaching techniques and strategies, as OVS does an amazing job at making it seem like you are in a regular classroom. It is so interesting to stay at home and achieve your study goals, especially now. With OVS, you can access the lessons whenever you want, and I think that’s the best part.

###### Do you have any advice for people considering online learning?

I would suggest students to study at OVS. It uses the most effective learning techniques for the students to achieve their study goals in short time.
