Halloween treats have been handed out, but for high school seniors, we’ve still got some tricks up our sleeves – tricks and tips for post-secondary research and applications, that is!

### Part-time OVS Students:

Your day school should already have issued your PIN letter. Remember, you can create your OUAC account (and have your marks updated) even *before* you decide where to apply. So don’t delay – create your account and [add OVS as an additional school](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/understanding-the-2021-ouac-application/) so our office can update your enrollment and marks as they’re processed!

### Full-time OVS Students:

OVS has issued PIN letters to all its full-time students, along with instructions on creating your OUAC account. If you have lingering questions, please connect with [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or book a guidance appointment for one-on-one support.

[Our OUAC Information](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ouac-info-updates/) and [OCAS Information](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ocas-info-updates/) pages are your one-stop shop for complete listings of important dates for the 2022 application cycle. Be sure to check out [our main blog page](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ovs-news-blog/) all month long for tailored blogs to help guide as you make these key decisions!

## Pssst! Keep your eyes peeled for OVS’s new podcast series – coming later this Fall!
