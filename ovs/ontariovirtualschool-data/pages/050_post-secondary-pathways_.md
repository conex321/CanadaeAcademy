Completing high school is one of life’s first great accomplishments, but it’s important to realize that it, too, is just another stepping stone on the path to reaching your full potential. As graduation draws nearer, high schoolers are faced with a very important decision: what do I want to do next?

Choosing a particular field of study—and wondering if it will lead to a fulfilling career one day—is a crucial step in creating the future you. In this series, we will focus on the various pathways you may wish to explore through post-secondary study. Each installment will focus on a particular field (i.e. the Sciences, Business, Math) and will provide a general idea of which courses you should be looking to take throughout high school to satisfy prerequisite requirements, which post-secondary programs and institutions are particularly recognized within the field, and what kinds of careers you might choose to pursue once you earn credentials in that field.

This series is intended as a guide to inform your future academic decisions and recognizes the value in all pathway decisions.
