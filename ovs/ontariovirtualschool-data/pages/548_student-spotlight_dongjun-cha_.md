Dongjun Cha is a young student from Korea. After coming to Canada and studying at [Robert Bateman Secondary School](https://robertbateman.abbyschools.ca/) in British Colombia, Dongjun was set to graduate and move on to university. Unfortunately, he ran into an all-too common problem: he realized he was missing a required course for acceptance into the university program of his dreams! Luckily, Dongjun discovered [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/).

By enrolling with OVS, Dongjun was able to take the final class he needed at his own pace, which meant that instead of postponing his university goals by a semester, or even a full year, he was able to put in the work and complete the required credit quickly enough to move on with his program admission as planned.

Now that this final hurdle has been surpassed, we asked Dongjun a few questions about his experience with OVS. Here’s what he had to say.

###### What made you decide to enroll with OVS?

I needed to take [Grade 12 Calculus and Vectors](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mcv4u/) so that I could get accepted by a university I want to go to.

###### What did you find most helpful about the OVS experience?

OVS has helped very much with my math. Not only did it do a great job teaching me calculus, but I also really liked the review unit that the course started with as it helped me brush up on my math skills before attempting the course.

*Editor’s Note: Almost all senior-level OVS courses include a Unit 0 for this exact reason!*

###### What are you doing now that you’ve graduated from OVS? Do you feel OVS helped to prepare you for your current activities?

As I’m studying Computer Science, math was very important to me. OVS helped me a lot prepare for the university!

###### What were some of your favourite parts of your experience with OVS?

I think OVS was very beneficial in that I could study anytime and anywhere. I also liked the high-quality service that they provided. I could [email my teacher](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/meet-our-staff/) and she would respond within a few hours. Also, when I emailed the office or I contacted the guidance department, they would respond right away and helped me so much.

###### Do you have any advice for people who may be considering online learning?

I think if you need a credit or two, you should definitely take a course with OVS because it is the best online school in the world. They have been around for more than a decade and they really know what they are doing.
