Have you completed your OUAC application yet? If not, better hurry – January 15th is the deadline to apply! Note: the 15th is only the deadline to CREATE your account with OUAC and apply to your intended institutions. Universities do not begin looking for grades until early February, so you do not need to have all marks submitted by this date. If you would like your enrollment or a final mark added to your account, be sure to add “Ontario Virtual School” as an alternate school in the “Academic Information” section. This can be added at any time, but must be saved in order for our administration to update your OVS marks.

Have you already completed your application but don’t see your Grade 11/12 OVS marks or current enrollment listed? Please contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to have this information updated!
