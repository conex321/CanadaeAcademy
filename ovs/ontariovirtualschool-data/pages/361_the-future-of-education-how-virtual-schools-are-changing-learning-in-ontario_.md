**Ontario Virtual School (OVS)**, fully accredited by the Ontario Ministry of Education, allows students to complete credits online at their own pace. Learners can begin anytime, work at their own pace, and receive support from certified Ontario teachers. This flexibility helps students balance school with athletics, travel, or work. This model is increasingly valued in 21st-century education.
