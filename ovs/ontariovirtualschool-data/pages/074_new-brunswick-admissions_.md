Traditional high school models limit students to attending school in their local district. With [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), we bring the Ontario curriculum to you – wherever you are! Whether you are in Grade 9 or Grade 12, we can help you transition to the Ontario high school curriculum.

# Cross-Provincial Equivalencies

High school course curriculums and naming conventions differ in each province. However, they are all comparable. This chart reflects credits commonly deemed as equivalent between New Brunswick and Ontario for key Grade 12 courses. This chart is by no means not exhaustive and is intended as a reference only. Please contact OVS Admin for clarification on acceptable subject equivalencies.
