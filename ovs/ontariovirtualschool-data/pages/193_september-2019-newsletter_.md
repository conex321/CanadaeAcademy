**TEACHER SPOTLIGHT: MEET MS. HANSEN**

Hi, my name is Rebecca Hansen and I am a math teacher with OVS!

When I’m not teaching, I love to travel. In fact, I spent two years living in China and travelling all over Asia at the start of my teaching career. Of all my travels thus far, Thailand has been my favourite!

Ms. Hansen is currently accepting new students for MDM4U.
