According to [UNESCO](https://www.unesco.org/en/literacy/need-know), acquiring literacy is not a one-off act. It is a process that extends beyond the typical components of reading, writing and counting skills. As identified by experts in the field, literacy is now understood as a means of “identification, understanding, interpretation, creation, and communication in an increasingly digital, text-mediated, information-rich and fast-changing world”. More than just an acquired skill, literacy is a continuum of learning and proficiency in reading, writing and using numbers that continue to expand and evolve as people engage more and more with information and learning through digital technology and beyond.

## Importance of Literacy Skills in Ontario

In Ontario, [EQAO](https://www.eqao.com/about-eqao/who-we-are/) is an arm’s length government agency that contributes to the quality and accountability of Ontario’s publicly funded education system for K-12. The agency is dedicated to enhancing the quality and accountability of the education system in Ontario and to work with the education community. Recognizing the importance and value of strong literacy skills for students, EQAO uses the [Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test (OSSLT)](https://www.eqao.com/the-assessments/osslt/) to measure whether students are meeting the minimum standard for literacy across all subjects up to the end of Grade 9. Successful completion of the literacy test is one of the requirements to earn an [Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD)](https://www.ontario.ca/page/earning-your-high-school-diploma).

“*Literacy is essential for success: it affects all academic achievement and is associated with social, emotional, economic, and physical health. The Grade 9 English course is designed to support students in developing and consolidating the literacy knowledge and skills they need to succeed in education and in life, and to encourage students to experience the joy and possibility that literacy learning can ignite.*”
