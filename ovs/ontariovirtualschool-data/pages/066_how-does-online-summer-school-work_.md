# How Does Online Summer School Work? - Ontario Virtual School

**Source:** https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/how-does-online-summer-school-work
**Description:** There are many reasons students may enroll in summer school courses. Maybe they want to get ahead on next year’s course load by taking a compulsory course early, like Grade 12 English (ENG4U), or they want to upgrade their marks in a difficult course they already finished, like Grade 11 Biology (SBI3U). They may just want to prepare themselves for the upcoming year as they transition from Junior High to High School.

There are many reasons students may enroll in summer school courses. Maybe they want to [get ahead](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/reach-ahead-elementary-students/) on next year’s course load by taking a [compulsory course](https://www.ontario.ca/page/earning-your-high-school-diploma) early, like Grade 12 English ([ENG4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4u/)), or they want to [upgrade their marks](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/upgrade-courses/) in a difficult course they already finished, like Grade 11 Biology ([SBI3U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sbi3u/)). They may just want to [prepare themselves for the upcoming year](https://www.ontario.ca/page/getting-ready-high-school) as they [transition from Junior High](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/learn-at-home-with-our-free-high-school-transition-courses/) to High School. Whatever the reason, many students find taking [summer school courses online](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/online-summer-school-courses/) to be an easier and more convenient option, but many have questions before making the decision to sign up for a course. Here are answers to questions we at [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/) hear from families every summer.

### How quickly can I complete an online summer course at Ontario Virtual School?

**21 days!** At [OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/faq/), students move through courses at their own pace. Though there is a minimum time that must be spent with the course, to ensure students fully grasp the material, in the Summer, this time is shortened. We understand that students sometimes wish to dedicate more time per day to their Summer courses, and thus complete them faster. While most courses can be completed in as few as four weeks, if you register in July or August, you can complete a course in as few as 21 days.

### Can I take multiple courses during the summer?

![Summer School Blog - Multiple Courses](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/Summer-School-Blog-Multiple-Courses-300x251.png)

Certainly! Students are free to enroll in several courses at the same time. Typically we recommend that students take a maximum of 2-3 courses with OVS if they are not a full-time student with our school.

Of course, they must be careful to not overwhelm themselves with too much work, but even if they are unable to complete a course in time, they can even continue into the fall, taking up to twelve months to complete a course, if they need it.

### Will my credits be recognized by my day school or post-secondary program?

![_Summer School Blog - Ministry Accredited](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/Summer-School-Blog-Ministry-Accredited-300x251.png)

Absolutely! Ontario Virtual School is fully accredited, and credits earned as OVS are recognized by [other high schools](https://www.ontario.ca/page/find-your-school) and [post-secondary](https://www.ouinfo.ca/universities) [institutions](https://www.ontariocolleges.ca/en/programs), the same as credits earned at your regular day school. Online OSSD credits are exactly the same as any others. You can even earn your Ontario Secondary School Diploma online!

### Are there courses available for students transitioning from middle to high school?

![Summer School Blog - Transition Courses](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/Summer-School-Blog-Transition-Courses-300x251.png)

Yes! In fact, OVS offers four FREE [courses designed to help students transition into high school](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/learn-at-home-with-our-free-high-school-transition-courses/), including [“Preparing for Grade 9 Math” (OVS1O)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/free-courses/grade-9-math-preparation-course/), [“Developing Effective Learning Skills” (OVS2O)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/free-courses/grade-9-learning-skills-course/), [“Fostering Digital Literacy” (OVS3O)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/free-courses/grade-9-digital-literacy-course/), and [“Supporting Mental Health” (OVS4O)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/free-courses/grade-9-mental-health-course/). Ontario Virtual School even offers “[Reach Ahead](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/reach-ahead-elementary-students/)” credits, which allow students currently enrolled in Grade 8 to take up to three Grade 9 credits, giving them a real head start on high school.

### Can international students enroll in OVS’s online summer courses?

Of course! In fact, since Ontario Virtual School courses are fully online, you don’t even have to be in Ontario to take them. This makes them perfect for students who are travelling over the summer, planning to come to Ontario in the fall, or even for students who live elsewhere, but still want to earn Ontario Secondary School credits. Online learning offers many benefits for [international students.](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/international-students/)

Whatever your reason for enrolling in summer school, whether you want to get a head start on next year with some Ontario eLearning Courses, or if you just want to take High School Upgrade Courses online, taking those courses online has significant advantages.
