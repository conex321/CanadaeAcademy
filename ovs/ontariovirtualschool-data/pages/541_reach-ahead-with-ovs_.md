# Reach Ahead with OVS to earn a Grade 9 credit in Grade 8!

As students approach high school age, they often experience contradictory feelings. On the one hand, high school can be intimidating to a young student – they don’t know what to expect. On the other hand, students often feel a sense of excitement at the idea of moving on to this new stage of their lives! After all, it brings both increased responsibility and opportunity – both things young students crave. But whether your learner is nervous about high school or eager to start, chances are your child can benefit from [the Reach Ahead Program](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/reach-ahead-elementary-students/)!

The Reach Ahead Program allows students in Grade 8 to take up to three high school level credits ahead of time. To do so, students require permission from their current or intended school. This program offers students currently in their Grade 8 year a unique opportunity to get ahead. It also helps kids [stay focused on academics](https://www.thebraggingmommy.com/3-tips-to-prevent-your-child-from-slipping-through-the-cracks/) throughout the summer prior to Grade 9. As a ministry-inspected high school, [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca) is authorized to grant Reach Ahead credits.

There are several reasons why reaching ahead offers an excellent opportunity for students making the transition to high school.

###### 1. Reach Ahead helps ease anxieties around this major change.

Starting high school means entering a new school, a new environment, and new peers. For some students, this may even be the first time they’ve changed schools. By working through a high school course ahead of time, Grade 8 students can alleviate some of the curriculum-based anxieties surrounding this big step, leaving them feeling more prepared for the changes to come in September.

> I was really scared of Math when I started high school. If I was able to learn the stuff ahead of time it would’ve reduced my anxiety about the course. – Michael

###### 2. Reach Ahead allows students to recognize and prepare for the rigor of high school study.

If your learner excels in their reach ahead credit, they will undoubtedly walk into their high school halls with a confident spring in their step. If, however, they find the jump in expectation to be a challenge, they will have time yet to adjust their learning and study habits to account for the increased rigorr, [ensuring increased success in later studies](https://www.thebraggingmommy.com/3-tips-to-prevent-your-child-from-slipping-through-the-cracks/). Ultimately, reaching ahead provides students a first-hand, realistic understanding of the expectations of the high school curriculum. Thus, providing them with much-desired context when choosing the rest of their Grade 9 courses.

###### 3. Reach Ahead offers a unique opportunity to lighten their Grade 9 workload.

If you’re worried about a particular Grade 9 course (say, [French](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/fsf1d/)) and want to get it out of the way, or if you’re anxious about managing 4-8 [required courses](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ossd-requirements/) at once, Reach Ahead may be the solution you’re looking for! By completing a mandatory credit in advance, students can reduce the difficulty of their first year by having fewer courses (or fewer ‘heavy’ courses\*) to work through. This then offers more time to dedicate to the rest of their courses, making their overall experience more manageable. After all, a more manageable workload provides more room for greater success.

> I would definitely have taken the French course to get it over with before going to high school! I was never good in French, and didn’t plan to take more French courses after grade 9. – Anisha

###### 4. Reach Ahead can help students take additional electives or fast-track their degree.

Students who successfully complete reach ahead credits open up doors to additional elective courses. Depending on their school administration\*, students may also choose to take a Grade 10 course in the second semester of their Grade 9 year, freeing up time in a later year for a spare, additional electives, or even helping a student follow a path to early graduation!

*\*Some day schools may not allow Grade 9 students to take a spare and will instead schedule them to take an additional elective credit. In these cases, students will receive the spare in a later year. When contacting the day school to receive permission to reach ahead, we encourage you to ask about the school’s policy surrounding first-year scheduling.*
