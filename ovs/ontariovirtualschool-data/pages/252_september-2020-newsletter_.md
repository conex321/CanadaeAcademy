This year’s back-to-school excitement has been clouded by uncertainty, and even trepidation, for many.
 In addition to pens, pencils, binders and rulers, students and parents are arming themselves with masks,
 gloves and sanitizers galore. As students across the country were introduced to e-learning last Spring,
 many look to reliable online options to ensure a safe return to school this September.

As a Ministry-accredited school with over 10 years of online-only experience, OVS offers an easy-to-use platform that supports multiple learning styles. Our self-paced, fully online courses alleviate concerns of in-person contact, unreliable or ever-changing schedules, as well as general social anxieties stemming from months of isolation.

Get in touch with our office today to inquire about switching your child to online full-time, or check [our website](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/full-time-student-info/) for more information!
