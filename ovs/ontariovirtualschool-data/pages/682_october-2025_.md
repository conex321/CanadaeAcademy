As October comes to an end, we approached the midterm point of the first semester for many Ontario students. In this newsletter, we’ll go over important OUAC submission dates and the Ontario Secondary School Literary Test, as well as some new courses and student spotlights for OVS.

## OUAC Deadlines

![](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025-OUAC-Heading.png)

During the 2025-2026 application cycle, OUAC has set dates during which most Ontario schools will submit available grades. These periods are referred to as ‘Collection Periods’. This year, there are four significant collection periods for any available grades.

As a reminder, OVS is not a semestered institution. We have the ability to submit your grades any time, including outside of collection periods. Though most schools only submit during the designated windows, any current enrolments, midterms, or final marks can be submitted at your request.

Please note that universities do not expect all final grades to be in until the final collection period, in June/July. If you miss an earlier collection period, your grade can be submitted during a following collection period or between periods. Please note, however, that **the final collection period for current grade 12 students closes on July 7th** and all grades should be submitted by that time.

#### **Collection Period 1: In Progress and Midterm Grades First Semester**

* + - * OVS Deadline for Submitting Work – **November 13th 2025**
      * OUAC Deadline for Submission – **November 20th 2025**

#### **Collection Period 2: In Progress and Final Grades First Semester**

* + - * OVS Deadline for Submitting Work – **February 5th 2026**
      * OUAC Deadline for Submission – **February 12th 2026**

#### **Collection Period 3: In Progress and Midterm Grades Second Semester**

* + - * OVS Deadline for Submitting Work – **April 17th 2026**
      * OUAC Deadline for Submission – **April 24th**

#### **Collection Period 4: Final Grade for all Courses**

* + - * OVS Group 1 Deadline for Submitting Work – **June 5th 2026**
      * OVS Group 2 Deadline for Submitting Work – **June 26th 2026**
      * OUAC Deadline for Submission – **July 7th 2026**

Deadlines for submitting work for marking are non-negotiable. Dates are set 1 week prior to OUAC deadlines to allow teachers adequate time to mark submitted work. Teachers have many students following the same deadline. **We will not ask teachers to mark faster than the 1-2 business day** **turnaround time**.

**We cannot guarantee that work handed in after the OVS deadline** (highlighted in red) will be marked in time for grades to be sent during collection periods. It is imperative that you follow these deadlines if you want grades submitted to OUAC during the collection period. OVS does not have any ability to adjust dates for OUAC, so you must follow these dates.

**What group am I?**

At this time, you do not need to determine your grouping. OVS will announce group criteria prior to Collection period 4.

#### **Summer Grade Collections**

OUAC does not set specific deadline dates for summer. Students may request grades be entered onto OUAC up until the end of summer. Students must ensure they follow any deadlines provided by their universities. It is also imperative that students keep the following in mind our summer deadlines:

* + - OVS does not post specific dates by which work must be handed in. Students must ensure they submit assessments **with enough time for teachers to mark.** During busy periods and summer, marking may take 1-3 business days due to high volume of summer grades. We advise submitting all work **at least 1 week prior** to the date your university needs grades.
    - We will not rush teachers for summer grades. Students are welcome to notify their teachers regarding any upcoming deadlines, but we will always allow our teachers their provided time to mark assessments.

If you are in danger of missing your deadline, you must contact your university to request an extension on your grades. **Do not ask OVS to rush your grade or move your deadline**, as we do not have the ability to.

## New OVS Course

[The Grade 11 Understanding Canadian Law](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/clu3m/) course explores Canadian law, with a focus on legal issues that are relevant to the lives of people in Canada. Students will gain an understanding of laws relating to rights and freedoms in Canada; our legal system; and family, contract, employment, tort, and criminal law. Students will develop legal reasoning skills and will apply the concepts of legal thinking and the legal studies inquiry process when investigating a range of legal issues and formulating and communicating informed opinions about them.

## Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test

As a graduation requirement Ontario high school students need to complete the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test (OSSLT).

Full-Time OVS students in Grade 10 or above **who are located in Ontario** will be required to complete the Literacy Test.

There are two sessions for the Literacy Test.

The Fall Literacy Test dates are between **November 4th 2025 and December 2nd 2025**.

The Winter Literacy Test dates are between **March 23rd 2026 and April 20th 2026**.
