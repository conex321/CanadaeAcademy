## Fundamental Concepts Covered in Grade 12 English Online Course

The English curriculum is dedicated to developing the knowledge and skills on which literacy is based – that is, knowledge and skills in the areas of listening and speaking, reading, writing, and viewing and representing. Students need language skills in order to comprehend ideas and information, to interact socially, to inquire into areas of interest and study, and to express themselves clearly and demonstrate their learning. As students read and reflect on a rich variety of literary, informational, and media texts,1 they develop a deeper understanding of themselves and others and of the world around them. Students use and develop important language skills as they read and think about topics, themes, and issues in various subject areas. Language facility helps students to learn in all subject areas, and using language for a broad range of purposes increases both their ability to communicate with precision and their understanding of how language works. Students develop flexibility and proficiency in their understanding and use of language over time. The English curriculum is based on the belief that language learning is critical to responsible and productive citizenship, and that all students can become successful language learners. The curriculum is designed to provide students with the knowledge and skills that they need to achieve this goal. It aims to help students become successful language learners.

**Successful language learners:**

* Understand that language learning is a necessary, life-enhancing, reflective process;
* Communicate – that is, read, listen, view, speak, write, and represent – effectively and with confidence; make meaningful connections between themselves, what they encounter in texts, and the world around them;
* Think critically;
* Understand that all texts advance a particular point of view that must be recognized, questioned, assessed, and evaluated;
* Appreciate the cultural impact and aesthetic power of texts;
* Use language to interact and connect with individuals and communities, for personal growth, and for active participation as world citizens.

## Online Teaching and Learning Strategies

Teachers will bring enthusiasm and varied teaching and assessment approaches to the classroom, addressing individual students’ needs and ensuring sound learning opportunities for every student. The activities offered should enable students to relate and apply these concepts to the social, environmental, and economical conditions and concerns of the world in which they live. Opportunities to relate knowledge and skills to these wider contexts will motivate students to learn in a meaningful way and to become life-long learners. Teachers will help students understand that problem solving of any kind often requires a considerable expenditure of time and energy and a good deal of perseverance. Teachers also will encourage students to investigate, to reason, to explore alternative solutions and to take the risks necessary to become successful problem solvers. Effective instructional approaches and learning activities draw on students’ prior knowledge, capture their interest, and encourage meaningful practise both inside and outside the classroom. Students will be engaged when they are able to see the connection between the scientific concepts they are learning and their application in the world around them and in real-life situations. Due to its importance, students will have opportunities to learn in a variety of ways- individually, cooperatively, independently, with teacher direction, through hands-on experiences, and through examples followed by practice. The approaches and strategies teachers use will vary according to both the object of the learning and the needs of the students. Teachers will accomplish this in online environment with the use of: virtual labs, online simulations, animations, videos, discussion forums, live chat and other interactive objects.

## Assessment & Evaluation

As summarized in [Growing Success 2010](http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/success.html), the primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning. Information gathered through assessment helps teachers to determine students’ strengths and weaknesses and adapt curriculum and instructional approaches accordingly.

As part of assessment, teachers provide students with descriptive feedback to help guide their learning Evaluation refers to the process of measuring the quality of work against an established criteria, and assigning a value representative of work quality. All curriculum expectations must be accounted for in instruction, but evaluation focuses on students’ achievement of the overall expectations.

A students’ achievement is evaluated in relation to specific expectations. Teachers use their professional judgement to determine which specific expectations should be used to evaluate achievement of overall expectations, and which ones will be covered in instruction and assessment but not used as an evaluation benchmark. To ensure assessment and evaluation are valid and fair teachers use assessment and evaluation strategies that:

* Address both what students learn and how well they learn
* Are based on the achievement level descriptions given in the achievement chart
* Are varied in nature, administered over time, and designed to provide opportunities for students to demonstrate the full range of their learning
* Are appropriate for the learning activities used, the purposes of instruction, and the needs and experiences of the students
* Are fair to all students
* Accommodate students with special education needs, consistent with the strategies outlined in their Individual Education Plan
* Accommodate the needs of students who are learning the language of instruction
* Ensure that each student is given clear directions for improvement
* Promote students’ ability to assess their own learning and to set specific goals
* Include student work samples as evidence their achievement
* Are communicated clearly to students and parents at the beginning of the school year and at other appropriate points throughout the school year.

The achievement chart outlines four categories of knowledge and skills:

1. Knowledge and understanding
2. Critical thinking
3. Communication
4. Application

Teachers assess and/or evaluate work in a balanced manner with respect to the four categories. A final grade is recorded, and a credit is granted and recorded for this course if the student’s grade is 50% or higher. The final grade for this course will be determined as follows:

**Seventy percent of the grade** is based on evaluations conducted throughout the course. This portion of the grade reflects the student’s most consistent level of achievement throughout the course, although special consideration should be given to more recent evidence of achievement.

**Thirty percent of the grade** is based on a final evaluation and administered towards the end of the course.

## Special Accommodations for Students with an IEP

Every single student is capable of success. Some students are able, with certain [accommodations](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/iep-accommodations/), to participate in the regular course curriculum and demonstrate independent learning.

[Accommodations](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/iep-accommodations/) allow access to the course without any changes to the [knowledge and skills the student is expected to demonstrate](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/assessment-evaluation/).

I decided to take this course through a friend's recommendation, who told me that it was a great experience. Despite that, I was still a bit unsure but decided to take a leap of faith and purchase the course. It was an amazing decision because this was the best way for me to achieve a high mark and thorough understanding of the course content. There were no hidden fees whatsoever, and once you paid the initial amount for the course, that was it. I'm a senior in high school and took MHF4U and it was a great experience. The lessons were easy to follow along and understand, and the workload was a breeze as well, considering how exceptional the teaching was. The Unit Tests were also very simple to follow along, especially with the phenomenal lessons and organization. I was also pleasantly surprised with the response time through emails, as it was very fast, with teachers and administrators. I also received my report cards very quickly, after submitting my request through the site. Plus, when I received marked work back, it was easy to follow along and helpful to see what I needed to work on. Overall, this was an absolutely awesome experience and i'd definitely recommend that anyone who is on the fence about taking an online course should for sure do it with OVS!

Ontario Virtual school was an amazing experience. They helped me earn a credit and achieve the grade I wanted. The teacher I had for my course (HFA4U) was extremely helpful and made it easy for me to understand the concepts taught in the course as the slideshows were easy to follow. The website was amazing and super easy to navigate through. It even allowed my parents to sign into my account as a "guardian" so they can look at my work and my sure I am on track. The lessons were super easy to follow as the slides shows were interactive and clear making it easy for the viewer to comprehend. There were no hidden fees at any given point during the corosue the expense was the flat fee (purchasing the course.) My work I submitted was always returned very quick and I was provided with feedback to always help me improve for the next assignment. When requesting my midterm and final report card the admin made it super easy as they processed it very quickly and sent it over to my school. Quick and simple!
Overall Ontario Virtual School was an amazing experience as the admin and staff are all professionals and made it easy for me to gain my credit while at the same time teaching me a lot as I left the course (HFA4U) with lots of great knowledge.

I took the MAP4C class and was able to complete my prerequisite course for my other academic adventures. My teacher Mr. Luu was very responsive with not only his feedback on tests and emails, but also with grading.
I highly recommend this course to anyone looking to upgrade or complete their math. Ontario Virtual School is a very simple website to navigate and I was happy to have found this online school.

My experience taking online courses with OVS was phenomenal! I took grade 12 Advanced Functions MHF4U and my teacher was Mr. Currie. He was extremely quick with responding to any of my questions and marking my tests, discussion posts and lab simulations. The corrections were always sent to me within 24h, even on the weekends! The course lessons were easy to follow and were delivered in an organized fashion. Doing the course at my own pace allowed me to achieve unmatched success. I would highly recommend OVS to any students interested in following the Ontario curriculum who are looking to "reach ahead" in their high school studies.

I recently took ENG 12 with Mr. Ford to upgrade my previous high school mark. It was very challenging but accessible. The lectures were well organized and easy to follow. Mr. Ford was very, very prompt with grading and answering emails. The expectations of the course were realistic and the practice test/exam was something I wish I'd had in high school. Not only were there practice questions but tips on what was expected from each answer. All-in-all a great experience.
