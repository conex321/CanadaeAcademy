**Description:** If you are considering attending the Ontario Virtual School, either full-time or part-time, you may have looked online to read some reviews. Our reviews are overwhelmingly positive, with an astounding 4.9/5-star rating on Google. Students are generally pleased with the flexibility of the classes, the lesson structure and content, and the friendliness of the staff. Online high school reviews can be great to get a general idea of the experiences of students, but they’re not very in-depth. So, I decided to ask students to share their experiences at OVS.

If you are considering attending the [Ontario Virtual School](http://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca), either full-time or part-time, you may have looked online to read some reviews. [Our reviews](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/recommendations-students-parents/) are overwhelmingly positive, with an astounding 4.9/5-star rating on Google. Students are generally pleased with the flexibility of the classes, the lesson structure and content, and the friendliness of the staff. Online high school reviews can be great to get a general idea of the experiences of students, but they’re not very in-depth. So, I decided to ask students to share their experiences at OVS.

## Why did you choose online high school?

A grade 12 student named Laelle, who has taken 3 courses with OVS, said that she decided to take courses at our school so she could have more free time and so she could focus on more difficult courses that she is taking at her day school.

Carla, a [grade 12 biology](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sbi4u/) student, said that she chose OVS because of the flexibility it offered her by allowing her to complete courses from outside of Ontario. Additionally, the college program she plans to attend has specific course requirements that she needs to meet, which she is able to do through her credits earned at OVS.

Yewande, a student who has taken 4 courses at OVS, said she chose our school because of the good reviews it has and because a university recruiter recommended it. She hopes to get accepted into a medical microbiology program with her credits from OVS.

Bowen, a student who is also enrolled in [SBI4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sbi4u/), said he chose our school because he “wanted the flexibility to learn online and take a course that fits [his] schedule.” The flexibility of OVS’s courses is a huge appeal to many students, including Carla and Yewande.

## What is a benefit you have experienced from taking online courses?

Common benefits students experience with online courses at OVS are being able to work at your pace, to focus in a quiet space without the distractions of a regular classroom, to review the lessons as needed, and to fit the courses into your busy schedule, whether it’s day school, a job, sports, or socializing.

Bowen said, “I can work at my own pace and review lessons whenever I need, which helps me understand the material better.”

Laelle, said, “Taking online courses has helped me improve my time management skills. I’ve learned to make better use of my time and focus on completing assignments more efficiently.”

Yewande said, the biggest benefit has been “flexibility. If I don’t understand a topic, I simply play it again over and over, then I study at my own pace.” She added, these courses “also allow me to work and study at the same time according to my schedule and enable me to manage my time properly.”

            Carla said some of the things she liked most about our online courses were “flexibility, comfort, and control,” “accessing lessons from anywhere,” and the ability to “replay and review lessons whenever needed.” She also mentioned it’s great “preparation for colleges that have similar online platforms” and that she has been able to develop “independent learning skills, which will be very helpful in college and in life.”

## What has your experience been with the course materials?

Overall, the students reported a very positive learning experience in their courses. Yewande said she felt that the tests and assignments “prepare one for the exam” very well, although they can be somewhat lengthy. She also said the “teaching is great” and that she found the quizzes at the end of the lessons helpful because they showed how well she understood the topic in a low-stress way since the quizzes are not graded.

Carla found the lessons more challenging and said she sometimes found it difficult to decide which concepts were the most important to focus on. However, resources like practice tests and e-textbooks can be very beneficial in helping students understand the materials thoroughly and prepare for the tests. And as always, teachers are available to help when a student needs guidance.

Laelle’s experience has been “very positive”. She states that “the tests and assignments are manageable and straightforward.”

Bowen has a similar experience, saying, “the tests and assignments are clear and helpful. Overall, I feel like I am learning a lot in [my grade 12 biology] course.”

## Do you feel safe, respected, and valued at OVS?

One of the most important aspects of any classroom is having supportive teachers and feeling safe and accepted. This is a priority for the staff at OVS who make it their mission to make students and parents feel welcome and supported.

            Bowen agreed that he does feel supported and respected by the teachers and staff, as did Yewande, who said “the teachers are very responsive and I really, really enjoyed the courses.”

            Carla said, “The OVS teachers and community are very respectful, professional, and supportive. I really admire how quickly the teachers answer my questions and how hard-working they are.”

            Laelle similarly stated, “[I have] a very kind and supportive teacher, especially with her feedback and grading.”
