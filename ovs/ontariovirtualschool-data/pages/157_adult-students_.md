### How Will My Post-Secondary Institution Receive My OVS Marks?

Our administration team will help you send your OVS marks directly to your universities or colleges. Diplomas earned through adult online high school are widely accepted by the majority of universities. All we need is the admissions contact for the school and the student ID number they issued you when you applied.

### When Can I Start?

OVS offers continuous enrollment, meaning **students can register and begin their studies with us any day of the year** – including holidays! Access to course content is immediate upon receipt of payment.

We do not require permission from the day school for students to register, however students registering for the Reach Ahead Program do require permission from their day school. Registered students have up to 12 months from the date of registration to complete each course. This model allows students to follow a pace and schedule that is convenient for them.

**Please note:** There is a minimum enrollment period that students must meet to graduate with OVS. Please contact our office for more details.

### Is the Online High School for Adults Program Designed for Independent Study, Or Is There a Teacher?

Each student will be assigned to [an OCT-certified teacher](/meet-our-staff/) who will be available to support them as they work through course content.

Teachers are online daily and are available to answer any student inquiries via email within 24 business hours. Teachers also host [office hours](/introducing-office-hours-for-all-ovs-teachers/), during which times students can expect a more immediate response.

### How Will I Be Evaluated? Are There Tests Or Assignments?

All OVS courses include a variety of assessment types, similar to what you would find in a standard day school course. These include:

* Tests
* Quizzes
* Essays
* Pre-recorded audio/video presentations
* Research projects
* Written or media-based assignments
* Final exams

With the exception of tests and exams, all assignments are entirely self-paced and do not have specified deadlines.

### How Does Testing Work in an Online Adult School?

At OVS, tests are timed, closed-book evaluations written independently in the student’s home. Please note that [OVS allows all students up to 4 hours](/iep-accommodations/) to complete these 75-minute evaluations. During this extended time period, students must download, print, complete, and scan or photograph each page back into OVS’s Virtual Test Centre for marking by their teacher.

Tests do not need to be scheduled or completed on certain dates: it is entirely up to the student to decide when they are ready to begin. The timer will begin only once the test has been downloaded from our secure servers. [Learn more about how final exams work at OVS.](/final-exams/)

### How Will You Transfer My Grade To My School?

Upon completion of an OVS course, students will use the “Gradebook” tab within their course portal to request their final report card. From here, they confirm their main (home) school. OVS will then mail a stamped and sealed copy of the final report card directly to the school. Once the school receives this document, they will add the mark to the student’s Ontario Student Transcript (OST) and Ontario Student Record (OSR), to be counted towards completion of [the OSSD](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ossd-requirements/).

For senior students, OVS will also send midterm or final marks to [the OUAC](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ouac-info-updates/), [OCAS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ocas-info-updates/), or directly to post-secondary institutions, as needed. Students use the report request function to make these additional requests. Documents will only be sent to these institutions upon request by the student.

OVS has helped many mature students achieve their academic goals.
