Along with the changing of the seasons comes the new high school academic year. Senior students are already starting to plan for their university applications, while new grade 9 students are navigating the start of high school and the adjustments made to education this year.

There are new graduation requirements for incoming high school students, new OUAC application guidelines and rules for seniors, and as always, OVS has new courses to offer starting this school year. With so much change it can be easy to lose track of everything. In this newsletter, we’ll cover several of the changes being made both at OVS and for high school students overall.

## New Graduation Requirements

![](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/New-High-School-Graduation-Requirements-Header.png)

This year, there have been some fundamental changes to the graduation requirements for students who are just entering Grade 9. So, while students who entered high school last year will still be working off the original graduation requirements, new students have a different set of criteria they need to meet.

In order to help parents and students navigate these changes, [this article](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/2024-high-school-graduation-requirements/) breaks down these new and previous requirements.

## New Courses

OVS has been working hard to expand our course selection to offer a high-quality education to more students. We’ve added more courses to our Middle School program for  Grades 6, 7 and 8. As well, in keeping with the Ministry of Ontario education guidelines, we have also added several new high school courses.

#### Middle School Courses

[![](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/course-images/FRA6G-221x300.png)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/course-images/FRA6G.png)
:   Grade 6 Core French provides students with the opportunity to use their previous knowledge and apply new vocabulary and writing conventions to explore topics related to the social studies curriculum by exploring topics in French Canadian history.

As one of Canada’s official languages, French has long been part of the Ontario school curriculum. With the addition of French in [Grade 6](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/fra6g/), [Grade 7](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/fra7g/), and [Grade 8](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/fra8g/), OVS now offers a more complete French curriculum all the way from 6th to 12th Grade.

Along with French we’ve also added [Grade 7 Health and Physical Education](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/ppl7g/) to our middle school courses. This course emphasizes regular participation in a variety of enjoyable physical activities that promote lifelong healthy active living.

## High School Courses

#### Grade 9 Geography

[Grade 9 De-Streamed Geography](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/cgc1w/) and [Grade 9 French Immersion De-Streamed Geography](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/cgc1wf/) have been added to our course options as well. Similar with Math, Science and English, Geography has been de-streamed, allowing students more flexible learning options.

#### Grade 9 Business

## OUAC updates

      * You are under 21
      * You have an OSSD or are working towards an OSSD with six 4U/M courses.

## Ontario University Fairs

#### Ontario Universities’ Fair (OUF)

![Ontario-Universities-FAIR-featured](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/Ontario-Universities-FAIR-featured.webp)

[The OUF](https://www.ouevents.ca/ouf/) takes place from October 5th to 6th at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre (MTCC) in the South Building.

The fair runs from 9:30am to 5pm both days and offers free admission.

This is a great opportunity for current high school students to talk with representatives from different universities and to really start thinking about where they might want to apply to for post-secondary.

## Ontario University Regional Fairs

Regional Fairs are similar to the OUF in that they allow students to connect directly with different university representatives to discuss their post-secondary plans and have their questions answered about what program might be right for them.

Regional Fairs take place in different cities ad local high school, university, and other community venues.

To check for Regional Fairs taking place near you, please check [the schedule](https://www.ouevents.ca/regional/).
