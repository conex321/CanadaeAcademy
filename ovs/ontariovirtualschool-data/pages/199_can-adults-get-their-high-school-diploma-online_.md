It happens all the time: people decide to pursue a new career path only to discover they can’t because [they never completed their high school diploma](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75-006-x/2017001/article/14824-eng.htm). In some cases, they already have a diploma but realize they need [one extra credit](https://www.dcp.edu.gov.on.ca/en/course-descriptions-and-prerequisites/introduction), say [ENG4U (Grade 12 English)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4u) or [MCV4U (Grade 12 Calculus and Vectors)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/mcv4u)—that they didn’t take before graduation. Many feel discouraged by this barrier, but thanks to modern online schools, finishing those Grade 12 U-level requirements (for example, [SBI4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/sbi4u) for university-bound science programs) has never been more straightforward. With flexible scheduling, interactive lessons, and support from certified teachers, adult learners can complete their remaining credits entirely online. If you’re worried about deadlines, or how to transfer credits, don’t fret, here are some frequently asked questions (and answers!) to help you get started.

## Is it too late to go back to high school?

It’s never too late! You can earn your high school diploma at any age, and here at [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), we have many resources specifically for our [Mature Students.](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/adult-students/) In fact, as seen from [our](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/student-spotlight/charlotte-casiano/) [alumni](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/student-spotlight/samantha-kaszas/) [testimonials](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/student-spotlight/win-pe/), the online format makes it very easy to go back to school at any age.

## How does online school work?

It depends on the school, but here at OVS, all of our lessons are recorded, and students can access them at any time. Tests and assignments also have no deadlines, so students can move through the course at their own pace. Once you complete all of the assessments, you earn the credit for the course.

## Can I finish my last year of high school online?

![](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/Grade-12-Icon-150x150.png)

Yes! You can complete any year of high school online. In fact, the highly flexible schedules allowed by OVS’s Learning Management System make this an ideal option for people who are returning to high school to complete those last few credits, and may not have time to attend an in-person school every day.

## Can you get your high school diploma online?

Definitely! So long as you’re attending an accredited online high school, like Ontario Virtual School, and you fulfill all the OSSD requirements, you can earn your Ontario Secondary School Diploma online.

## How do you graduate from online school?

When you sign  up and start working on your [Ontario Secondary School Diploma requirements](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ossd-requirements/), simply let our administration and guidance departments know that you wish to graduate. Once you’ve completed your courses, let the OVS staff know if you wish to submit your marks for any [post-secondary programs.](https://www.ontariocolleges.ca/en/programs) We will ensure that your marks are sent appropriately, and that you get your diploma, and continue with your educational pathway.

## Do you graduate faster in online school?

That’s up to you! While different schools may have set schedules, at OVS, you can move through courses at your own pace. You have to be enrolled for at least 28 days (though you have up to 1 year to complete a course). That means that if you have more time to dedicate to a course, or if you simply find the material easier to understand, you can complete it more quickly. Rather than sticking to the school’s schedule, the school moves at your schedule. While there are still limits on how many courses you can complete at once with OVS (2 courses per one month of enrollment), if you wish to graduate faster, then you can do just that.
