Faith is a former OVS graduate who is currently studying Physics and Philosophy at [King’s College in London, England](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/physics-and-philosophy-bsc).

Faith came to OVS from a homeschooling background, before completing Grade 11 and 12 with us in order to earn her Ontario Secondary School Diploma.

We asked Faith a few questions about her experience with OVS.

## Why Did You Choose OVS?

For the last ten years, my family and I have worked in Zambia, Africa with an NGO that builds schools for orphans and vulnerable children. Such a shift in our lives, left us wondering how I could achieve my OSSD while living abroad. My mom heard about OVS from a friend and enrolled me in their program. I was so thankful to find a program that could grant me my OSSD despite my unique living situation. The fact that I could access my lessons and submit my evaluations any time I wanted was extremely helpful for me since I lived in a country 6 hours ahead of Toronto time. OVS allowed me to finish high-school with lessons that challenged me and a program that allowed me to achieve my post-secondary dreams..

## How Has OVS Prepared You For Life Outside of High School?

I believe that OVS taught me the valuable lessons of self-discipline and independent research. As I head to university, these lessons are invaluable since university-life revolves around those concepts as you have to push yourself to learn and grow in that setting.

## What Were Your Most Memorable Parts of Learning With OVS?

* The timely teacher responses to emails
* The timely feedback/marks to tests and assignments
* Overall student support from teachers and administration
* Ease of use of the LMS (accessing the lessons, the tests, the teaching resources etc)

## What Advice Would You Share With Students Who May Be Looking to Take Courses Outsides of Their Day School?

I highly recommend the online learning platform that is found in OVS as it allows you to learn lessons of self-discipline and independence which will be able to take you far in life regardless of whether or not you choose to do post-secondary education. In addition, if you have a lifestyle that requires flexible deadlines, OVS is the right program for you.
