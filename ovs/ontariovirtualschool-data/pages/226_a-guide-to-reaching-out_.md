Often, we don’t ask for help when we need it because we don’t feel that our problems are “big enough” or “important enough” to warrant taking that sometimes-awkward first step to seek appropriate assistance. Some may not see themselves as deserving of proper mental care. And sometimes, we worry about being judged. There are so many reasons we concoct to prevent us from seeking the help our mental health deserves.

So, let us help you end that internal debate. The answer, if posed, is always **yes**.

When it comes to our mental health and sense of wellbeing, reaching out to talk to someone is always an excellent first step. In this article, we will outline some ways to approach initiating these “awkward” conversations, help you understand what you can expect from reaching out to discuss your mental health, and provide you with a wide array of resources for outreach.

At the end of the day, we all have mental health, and we all owe it to ourselves to care for it.

###### Helpful ways to start the conversation

“I don’t know if you can help me, but I’m hoping you can help me to find someone who can.”

“I’ve been feeling \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ lately, can I get your help?”

“I have a tough situation; it’s really bugging me… Can I talk to you about it?”

“I can’t seem to get past the feelings I’m having. I wanted to reach out before things got worse.”

With difficult conversations, it may be easier to “break the ice” by writing things down on paper or through text.

*Remember: reaching out to talk to someone doesn’t have to be in person.* For example: “Hey \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, it’s \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Do you have some time to chat with me tomorrow? I have a problem I want to talk to you about…”

###### What will happen after I reach out for help?

After talking to a trusted adult about how you’re feeling, it’s important to recognize that it can take time to feel better. The person you reach out to may not be able to “fix” the problem, but they may be able to connect you with someone who can support you better. They may need to set up an appointment for you to see someone else. If you find that your problems seem to be unresolved after initially seeking help, don’t give up. Keeping trying. You’ll find someone who can support you and let you know that you are not alone.

If you or someone you know is in crisis, call 9-1-1 or go to the nearest emergency department.
