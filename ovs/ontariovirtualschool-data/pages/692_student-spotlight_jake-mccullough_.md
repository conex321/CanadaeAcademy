Jacob was a full-time student with OVS and earned his Ontario Secondary School Diploma this past summer. He chose to complete his high school diploma online so that he could have the flexibility needed to pursue his dance training. We asked Jacob a few questions regarding his time with OVS.

## Why Did You Choose OVS?

I chose OVS because I decided to pursue professional level dance training at Joffrey Ballet School in New York City but I still wanted to study the Ontario curriculum for my high school education. OVS gave me the flexibility to work hard during breaks from my dance training and focus on dance during peak season.

## What Are Your Plans After High School?

I am on my third year of [Joffrey Ballet School’s Pre-Professional](https://www.joffreyballetschool.com/trainee-program) trainee program where I am currently dancing with the Joffrey Concert Group, Joffrey’s performance company. After my time at Joffrey, I will apply for my Bachelors of Fine Arts in Dance at various institutions in NYC.

> OVS has taught me how to be self-motivated, how to manage my time and how to take the initiative to find information or help when I need it.

## What Were Your Most Memorable Parts of Learning with OVS?

* The quality lessons, including the videos and narration
* The timely teacher responses to emails
* Ease of use of the LMS (accessing the lessons, the tests, the teaching resources etc)

> OVS is a great option for anyone who wants to work at their own pace and take control of their education.

All of us at Ontario Virtual School are proud to have helped Jake on his journey and wish him all the best with his career
