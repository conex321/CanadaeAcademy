# Full-Time Students

##### Full-Time Students meet the following three criteria:

* + 1. You intend to complete all remaining requirements and earn your high school diploma (OSSD) through OVS
    2. You are not currently enrolled at an Ontario day school OR you intend to withdraw your enrollment at your current school
    3. You have completed, or will complete, at least 3 credits in a single grade year through OVS

*Note: A student must register for a minimum of 3 credits before OVS will officially begin the transfer process. Students wishing to graduate through OVS without meeting this credit minimum will be required to pay an additional administrative fee.*

*There is a minimum enrollment period that students must meet in order to graduate with OVS. Please contact our office for more details.*
