### Samuel Poulin, 2019 First Round NHL Draft Pick & 2020 OVS Graduate

If you haven’t heard of [Samuel Poulin](https://www.nhl.com/player/sam-poulin-8481591) yet, chances are you will soon! Anyone who followed the 2019 NHL Draft may be familiar with him already: he was the [Pittsburgh Penguins](https://www.nhl.com/penguins/)’ first round pick. In fact, Samuel was [drafted 21st overall](https://www.nhl.com/penguins/news/penguins-select-samuel-poulin-in-the-first-round-of-the-2019-nhl-draft/c-307966482)!

Here at [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), along with our partners at [Northern Pre-University](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/partner/northern-pre-university-npu/), we have been following Sam’s incredible journey for quite some time. Much like [earning your high school diploma](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ossd-requirements/), becoming a first-round draft pick doesn’t happen overnight, nor without a great deal of hard work and dedication. Poulin has been a member and top prospect of [the Sherbrooke Phoenix](https://www.eliteprospects.com/team/11366/sherbrooke-phoenix/2019-2020?tab=stats) of the QMJHL since 2018. After discussions with both his agent and family, Samuel decided to [enroll in a full-time curriculum with OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/full-time-student-info/) and [Northern Pre-University](https://www.northernpreuniversity.com/).

In fact, being drafted into the NHL wasn’t Samuel’s only major accomplishment in recent years: [he also joined Team Canada at the IIHF Under-18 World Championship](https://ontariohockeyleague.com/article/7-ohl-players-to-represent-canada-at-world-u18-hockey-championship), where he put up one goal and one assist in seven tournament games as Canada finished 4th. He was also part of Team Canada’s Hlinka-Gretzky winning team, putting up one assist in five games. Like his father, [former NHLer Patick Poulin](https://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=4362), Samuel has done an exceptional job representing his country. Oh, and did we mention he did all this while also earning his [Ontario Secondary School Diploma](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ossd-requirements/)?
