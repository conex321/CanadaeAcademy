## Fundamental Concepts Covered in French Immersion Mathematics Online Course

This course builds on students’ previous experience with functions and their developing understanding of rates of change. Students will solve problems involving geometric and algebraic representations of vectors and representations of lines and planes in three dimensional space; broaden their understanding of rates of change to include the derivatives of polynomial, sinusoidal, exponential, rational, and radical functions; and apply these concepts and skills to the modelling of real-world relationships. Students will also refine their use of the mathematical processes necessary for success in senior mathematics. This course is intended for students who choose to pursue careers in fields such as science, engineering, economics, and some areas of business, including those students who will be required to take a university-level calculus, linear algebra, or physics course.

## Online Teaching and Learning Strategies

The mathematical processes are to be integrated into student learning in all areas of this course.
Throughout this course, students will:

* **Problem Solving** – develop, select, apply, compare, and adapt a variety of problem-solving strategies as they pose and solve problems and conduct investigations, to help deepen their mathematical understanding
* **Reasoning and Proving** – develop and apply reasoning skills (e.g., use of inductive reasoning, deductive reasoning, and counter-examples; construction of proofs) to make mathematical conjectures, assess conjectures, and justify conclusions, and plan and construct organized mathematical arguments;
* **Reflecting** – demonstrate that they are reflecting on and monitoring their thinking to help clarify their understanding as they complete an investigation or solve a problem (e.g., by assessing the effectiveness of strategies and processes used, by proposing alternative approaches, by judging the reasonableness of results, by verifying solutions)
* **Selecting Tools and Computational Strategies** – select and use a variety of concrete, visual, and electronic learning tools and appropriate computational strategies to investigate mathematical ideas and to solve problems
* **Connecting** – make connections among mathematical concepts and procedures, and relate mathematical ideas to situations or phenomena drawn from other contexts (e.g., other curriculum areas, daily life, current events, art and culture, sports)
* **Representing** – create a variety of representations of mathematical ideas (e.g., numeric, geometric, algebraic, graphical, pictorial representations; onscreen dynamic representations), connect and compare them, and select and apply the appropriate representations to solve problems
* **Communicating** – communicate mathematical thinking orally, visually, and in writing, using precise mathematical vocabulary and a variety of appropriate representations, and observing mathematical conventions

## Assessment & Evaluation

As summarized in [Growing Success 2010](http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/success.html), the primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning. Information gathered through assessment helps teachers to determine students’ strengths and weaknesses and adapt curriculum and instructional approaches accordingly.

As part of assessment, teachers provide students with descriptive feedback to help guide their learning Evaluation refers to the process of measuring the quality of work against an established criteria, and assigning a value representative of work quality. All curriculum expectations must be accounted for in instruction, but evaluation focuses on students’ achievement of the overall expectations.

A students’ achievement is evaluated in relation to specific expectations. Teachers use their professional judgement to determine which specific expectations should be used to evaluate achievement of overall expectations, and which ones will be covered in instruction and assessment but not used as an evaluation benchmark. To ensure assessment and evaluation are valid and fair teachers use assessment and evaluation strategies that:

* Address both what students learn and how well they learn
* Are based on the achievement level descriptions given in the achievement chart
* Are varied in nature, administered over time, and designed to provide opportunities for students to demonstrate the full range of their learning
* Are appropriate for the learning activities used, the purposes of instruction, and the needs and experiences of the students
* Are fair to all students
* Accommodate students with special education needs, consistent with the strategies outlined in their Individual Education Plan
* Accommodate the needs of students who are learning the language of instruction
* Ensure that each student is given clear directions for improvement
* Promote students’ ability to assess their own learning and to set specific goals
* Include student work samples as evidence their achievement
* Are communicated clearly to students and parents at the beginning of the school year and at other appropriate points throughout the school year.

The achievement chart outlines four categories of knowledge and skills:

1. Knowledge and understanding
2. Critical thinking
3. Communication
4. Application

Teachers assess and/or evaluate work in a balanced manner with respect to the four categories. A final grade is recorded, and a credit is granted and recorded for this course if the student’s grade is 50% or higher. The final grade for this course will be determined as follows:

**Seventy percent of the grade** is based on evaluations conducted throughout the course. This portion of the grade reflects the student’s most consistent level of achievement throughout the course, although special consideration should be given to more recent evidence of achievement.

**Thirty percent of the grade** is based on a final evaluation and administered towards the end of the course.

## Special Accommodations for Students with an IEP

Every single student is capable of success. Some students are able, with certain [accommodations](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/iep-accommodations/), to participate in the regular course curriculum and demonstrate independent learning.

[Accommodations](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/iep-accommodations/) allow access to the course without any changes to the [knowledge and skills the student is expected to demonstrate](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/assessment-evaluation/). The accommodations required to facilitate the student’s learning are identified by the teacher. Recommendations from a School Board generated [Individual Education Plan (IEP)](https://www.specialeducationguide.com/pre-k-12/individualized-education-programs-iep/the-iep-process-explained/) if available can also be consulted. Instruction based on principles of universal design and differentiated make it possible to meet the diverse needs of all learners.

**Examples of accommodations (but not limited to) include:**

* Adjusting or extending assessment deadlines
* Providing alternative assignments or summative tasks
* Use of scribes and/or other assistive technologies
* Simplifying the language of instruction

I decided to take this course through a friend's recommendation, who told me that it was a great experience. Despite that, I was still a bit unsure but decided to take a leap of faith and purchase the course. It was an amazing decision because this was the best way for me to achieve a high mark and thorough understanding of the course content. There were no hidden fees whatsoever, and once you paid the initial amount for the course, that was it. I'm a senior in high school and took MHF4U and it was a great experience. The lessons were easy to follow along and understand, and the workload was a breeze as well, considering how exceptional the teaching was. The Unit Tests were also very simple to follow along, especially with the phenomenal lessons and organization. I was also pleasantly surprised with the response time through emails, as it was very fast, with teachers and administrators. I also received my report cards very quickly, after submitting my request through the site. Plus, when I received marked work back, it was easy to follow along and helpful to see what I needed to work on. Overall, this was an absolutely awesome experience and i'd definitely recommend that anyone who is on the fence about taking an online course should for sure do it with OVS!

I recently took ENG 12 with Mr. Ford to upgrade my previous high school mark. It was very challenging but accessible. The lectures were well organized and easy to follow. Mr. Ford was very, very prompt with grading and answering emails. The expectations of the course were realistic and the practice test/exam was something I wish I'd had in high school. Not only were there practice questions but tips on what was expected from each answer. All-in-all a great experience.

My experience taking online courses with OVS was phenomenal! I took grade 12 Advanced Functions MHF4U and my teacher was Mr. Currie. He was extremely quick with responding to any of my questions and marking my tests, discussion posts and lab simulations. The corrections were always sent to me within 24h, even on the weekends! The course lessons were easy to follow and were delivered in an organized fashion. Doing the course at my own pace allowed me to achieve unmatched success. I would highly recommend OVS to any students interested in following the Ontario curriculum who are looking to "reach ahead" in their high school studies.

I took the MHF4U course at OVS, and the lessons were very descriptive and easy to understand. The tests were a good amount of difficulty, and you are given a more than reasonable amount of time to complete them. My teacher marked all my tests and final exam, in no more than a day, and was super helpful with any questions I had. My midterm and final marks were also uploaded to the OUAC in less than 2 days, and was a super easy process! I strongly recommend this course to anyone who's having a bit of trouble with how fast-paced their math class is at their day school, and wants to learn at their own comfortable speed.

Ontario Virtual school was an amazing experience. They helped me earn a credit and achieve the grade I wanted. The teacher I had for my course (HFA4U) was extremely helpful and made it easy for me to understand the concepts taught in the course as the slideshows were easy to follow. The website was amazing and super easy to navigate through. It even allowed my parents to sign into my account as a "guardian" so they can look at my work and my sure I am on track. The lessons were super easy to follow as the slides shows were interactive and clear making it easy for the viewer to comprehend. There were no hidden fees at any given point during the corosue the expense was the flat fee (purchasing the course.) My work I submitted was always returned very quick and I was provided with feedback to always help me improve for the next assignment. When requesting my midterm and final report card the admin made it super easy as they processed it very quickly and sent it over to my school. Quick and simple!
Overall Ontario Virtual School was an amazing experience as the admin and staff are all professionals and made it easy for me to gain my credit while at the same time teaching me a lot as I left the course (HFA4U) with lots of great knowledge.
