University can be a daunting yet exciting time for first year students. Setting yourself up for success will help you create a more enjoyable experience and ease the transition. In a digital world, you have the tools available to start setting yourself up for success early! No matter the grade, our courses will help you prepare for the university experience of your dreams. As Mel Robbins says, ‘the key to success is to start before you’re ready” (2017), and our programs are designed to help you take that first step towards achieving your academic goals.

As a high school educator, I often hear students say, “I need to get [insert percentage] in this course to get into [insert university]”. What I rarely hear is, “what skills do I need to succeed once I get in there”. Of course, to get into universities, a major factor is grades, however, we are not setting students up for success unless we also emphasize the skills that they need in order to succeed once they arrive at university. [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), an accredited online high school, has taken this problem and set up courses that provide students with not only the resources needed to achieve high marks, but with resources to develop important skills. The advantages of virtual learning extend far beyond the course content.

## 4 Ways OVS Builds University Readiness

So, what skills does one need to succeed in university, and what does “success in university” mean? At [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/), we want to see our students pursue their interests in university, obtaining a degree that will help them achieve success in their dream career while being able to pursue their interests, just like they did while they were students with us. [Online school](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/) provides students the opportunity to pursue their passions and strengths outside of school, while still maintaining the high standards that we set for our students and staff.

1. **Builds Time Management Skills**

Unlike traditional classrooms, [virtual learning](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/) gives students the flexibility to create their own schedule. In post-secondary, class times can vary daily, assignments have staggered deadlines, and many students juggle academics with varsity sports or part-time work. Time management for online students becomes easy as they’ve practiced lots! Whether you are pursuing swimming alongside your high school diploma like [Summer McIntosh](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/student-spotlight/summer-mcintosh/), or travelling the world, self-paced online high school allows you to pursue other interests which teaches students valuable time management skills that will be needed in university. You take control of your schedule and time – just like you will in university.

**2. Increases Self-awareness**

According to Dabbagh and Kitsantas (2012), virtual learning environments support self-regulation and metacognitive growth, helping students recognize their learning styles, strengths and areas for improvement. With [over 170 courses to choose from](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/part-time-enrollment-the-best-of-both-worlds/#:~:text=%232:%20Take%20Courses%20Not%20Offered,new%20courses%20developed%20every%20quarter!), students get the chance to explore a wide variety of topics taught by experts, including [Fashion (HNB4M)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/hnb4m/), [The Writer’s Craft (EWC4U)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/hnb4m/), [Canadian Politics (CPW4U)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/cpw4u/), and [Grade 12 Earth and Space Science (SES4U)](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/ses4u/). Online learning unlocks a variety of subjects not available in smaller school systems. This unique experience allows them to discover their academic interests early on. Not only will this help them succeed in their school work, but it will help them find “their people” when they get to school in a new town.

**3. Build Your Organization Skills**

In university, you will not have a rigid schedule to adhere to each day, monitored by teachers or parents. You are responsible for how you organize your time, your work, and your space. Online learning provides students with the opportunity to practice this skill, and a collection of valuable resources to help them do so. Learning how to use a calendar and check list or notes independently of the classroom resources, assures that students have these skills before being sent off into an environment where there will be less guidance.

**4. Increases Digital Literacy**

With [98% of universities shifting to online platforms](https://www.devlinpeck.com/content/online-learning-statistics#:~:text=98%25%20of%20universities%20have%20shifted%20to%20offer%20online%20courses&text=There%27s%20no%20question%20that%20the,of%20universities%20offer%20online%20courses), students must be comfortable using online tools, such as journals, discussion forums and dropboxes (Peck, 2025). At Ontario Virtual School, students are immersed in digital learning environments every day. We don’t just provide access to online tools- we teach students how to use them effectively, responsibly, and with confidence. As Mel Robbins says “success is not about your resources – it’s about how resourceful you are with what you have” (2017). Online learning provides students with opportunities to practice using these tools. By learning how to conduct research, cite sources, and avoid plagiarism, students reduce the risk of future serious academic offenses. In fact, [36% of university students admit to having plagiarized](https://liu.cwp.libguides.com/plagiarismprevention#:~:text=A%20study%20by%20The%20Center%20for%20Academic,caught%20or%20have%20never%20been%20appropriately%20disciplined) (Madray, 2024). Developing these skills early is now more important than ever. Our online learning environment prepares students to think critically, use digital tools wisely, and meet the demands of modern postsecondary education.
