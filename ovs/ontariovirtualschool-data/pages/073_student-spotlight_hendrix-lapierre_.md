> Hendrix Lapierre, 2020 First Round NHL Draft Pick & 2020 OVS Graduate

If you haven’t heard of [Hendrix Lapierre](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/201904/hendrix-lapierre) yet, chances are you will soon! Anyone who followed [the 2020 NHL Draft](https://www.nhl.com/nhl-draft) may be familiar with him already: he was the [Washington Capitals](https://www.nhl.com/capitals/)’ first round pick.

Here at Ontario Virtual School, along with [our partners at Northern Pre-University](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/partner/northern-pre-university-npu/), we have been following Hendrix’s journey for quite some time. In fact, being drafted into the NHL wasn’t Hendrix’s only accomplishment of 2020: he also became one of [OVS’s recipients of the Ontario Secondary School Diploma](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/student-spotlight-alumni/)!

Much like [earning your high school diploma](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/ossd-requirements/), becoming a first-round draft pick doesn’t happen overnight, nor without a great deal of hard work and dedication. Lapierre has been a member and top prospect of [the Chicoutimi Saguenéens](https://www.eliteprospects.com/team/533/chicoutimi-sagueneens) of the QMJHL since 2018. After several discussions regarding his post-secondary plans with both his agent and family, Hendrix decided to [enroll in a full-time curriculum with OVS](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/full-time-student-info/) and [Northern Pre-University](https://www.northernpreuniversity.com/).

Without the time constraints of a traditional school schedule, Hendrix was able pursue his studies in [French](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/french-immersion/), [English Literature](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/eng4u/), [History](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/chy4u/), [Business](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/bbb4m/), and more, while on the road with the Saguenéens. With [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/)’s fully online platform, Lapierre’s education was literally in the palm of his hand – accessible through the device of his choosing. And, with [OVS’s self-paced model](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/about-us/), there were no prescribed class times, no due dates, and no “filler” assignments to pass the time – just the material he needed to learn, [interactive multimedia lessons](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/chy4u/#iframe_container), and access to an [OCT-certified teacher](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/meet-our-staff/) to help whenever he needed. With this high degree of freedom and flexibility, Lapierre was able to maintain a high academic average, while performing at an elite level on the ice. In addition to being drafted first-round, Hendrix has also been accepted to [Algonquin College](https://www.algonquincollege.com/) for studies in Nutrition and Communication.

> OVS, and our partners at NPU, are incredibly proud of Hendrix and look forward to watching his future success. We’ve witnessed first-hand his diligence, discipline, and determination, and know that these skills and devotion will take him to incredible heights. Best of luck, both on the ice and off, Hendrix!
