There are many reasons someone might choose to leave traditional in-person schools and pursue online schooling instead, but if you’re still unsure whether online schooling is right for you, here are some of the advantages and disadvantages of virtual learning high schools.

## Social Life and Extracurriculars

Social life is an important aspect of high school for many students. In-person school is a great option for those who prioritize their social life and extracurricular activities such as sports and clubs. While online schools often try to foster a collaborative environment, in-person schools are ideal for creating and maintaining friendships. Social life in online high school can be a challenge, as can extracurricular activities for online students. One advantage of virtual high school, however, is that the flexible hours allow students to spend time with their friends and family outside of school.

## Time Management

Online schools allow students to create their own schedule and work at their own pace. Because of this, it’s important that students have good time management skills. If you are someone who needs a lot of external push to complete work, traditional schooling may be better for you. However, OVS is a self-paced online high school and allows students to complete high school faster. There are no deadlines, and students have one full year to complete their course. The flexible schedule of our high school appeals to many.

## Individual Support

Some students require a lot of direct support from the teacher, in which case, virtual school may not be for them. While the [Ontario Virtual School](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/) has integrated differentiated learning into courses, there are some things specified on [Individual Education Plans](https://www.ontario.ca/page/individual-education-plans) (IEPs) that may not be feasible for a virtual school. However, certified teachers are always available to assist students with any questions they may have and to work with the student as much as possible to ensure they can be successful.

## Type of Learner

Virtual schools are great options for independent learners who are self-motivated and want to work at their own pace. OVS offers flexibility and can be completed at a faster or slower pace, according to what works for students’ schedules. Some students may work a job and not be able to devote time every day to schoolwork, so OVS is a great option. Others may want to earn their credits quickly, and OVS allows students to earn theirs in as few as twenty-one days.

## Course Choices

OVS has many course options to suit the various needs of our students. However, the online format can be limiting in some regards, so high school courses like physical education, dance, and trades like welding, automotive, and carpentry are not offered. These types of courses are more hands-on and are thus only offered at in-person schools. However, OVS offers a huge selection, from Grade 12 Philosophy ([HZT4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/hzt4u/)) to Canadian and International Law ([CLN4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/cln4u/)), Grade 12 Computer Science ([ICS4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/ics4u/)) and the Ontario Literacy Course ([OLC4O](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/olc4o/)). There are even courses to challenge your creativity, like Drama ([ADA4M](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/ada4m/)), The Writer’s Craft ([EWC4U](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/ewc4u/)), Fashion ([HNB4M](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/hnb4m/)), and Photography ([AWQ4M](https://www.ontariovirtualschool.ca/courses/awq4m/)).

## OSSD & University/College Acceptance

Whether you choose online or in-person school, either can help you achieve your high school diploma. OVS is fully accredited so students can earn their OSSD credit online. Our school also has a very high rate of acceptance into post-secondary institutions: 98% of our students are accepted! OVS offers the flexibility and freedom students love, but doesn’t sacrifice learning, OSSD credits, or college / university acceptance.
