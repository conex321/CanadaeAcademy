Summer may be drawing to a close, but it’s not too late to register for a fast-track summer course with OVS – complete in as little as 3 weeks if you register before August 10th!

Missed the memo? No problemo! Registration is always open at OVS.

Register anytime after August 10th and you’ll simply need 28 days minimum enrollment to complete.

Need some more time? Any of our courses – even those purchased during fast-track summer eligibility – will have up to one full year to complete!

### Student Spotlight: Paralympian Abigail Tripp keeps busy during COVID closures & completes her OSSD online!

With the Paralympics postponed until Summer 2021, Paralympic swimmer, Abigail Tripp, took advantage of her limited ability to travel and train to set her sights on university instead!

“The OVS e-learning experience was one of the best I have experienced. […] I naturally love working independently and can motivate myself without outside factors, so the OVS model was ideal for me. […] As an athlete, online learning is beneficial because I can bring it with me wherever I go without the worry of falling behind.”
