When I enrolled in Ontario Virtual School for a grade 12 university level science course, I was scared that I wouldn't have a teacher to help me, but this wasn't the case. My teacher was readily available all the time to help me with any issues. The lessons were so well explained, and I learnt a lot. All the review I needed before tests was there, and there was no shortage of practice questions in the resources given to me. My assignments, unit tests, and even my exam were marked within 24 hours each time, with encouragement and clear, detailed feedback. I finished the course with an exceptional grade, and OVS is submitting my grade to OUAC and my high school for university consideration! I had a great experience, and I would recommend it to anyone thinking about it!

I chose OVS because it was very convenient for me and very easy to use. The lesson guide videos posted were very clear. I took grade 12 Calculus and Vectors MCV4U and got a 96% because I was able to understand the course material clearly. The teachers were very quick to reply to my emails in any area I didn't understand. I would definitely recommend this to use rather than the regular day school.

I completed SBI4U with OVS. My teacher, Ms. West has done a fantastic job in assisting me when needed. She responded to my emails very quickly, and answered my questions clearly. The lessons posted by OVS have also been very helpful and ensured that I had a clear understanding of the course. My marks were submitted through OUAC very quickly for university admissions. The best thing about OVS is that I had all the time I needed to complete my work.

Ontario Virtual School has been an absolute game-changer for me! The flexibility of online learning has allowed me to manage my time effectively and pursue my passions outside of school. Taking MHF4U online was a bit daunting at first, but the platform's resources and teacher support made it surprisingly manageable. I was able to learn at my own pace and really delve into the material. I highly recommend Ontario Virtual School to anyone seeking a quality online learning experience!

OVS has been an incredible experience for me! The ability to work at my own pace has made a huge difference in my learning. Unlike traditional schools with strict deadlines, OVS allows students to take the time they need to fully understand the material while balancing other responsibilities.

The courses are well-structured, and the platform is easy to navigate. The teachers are also supportive and responsive, always available to provide guidance when needed. Whether you're looking to accelerate your studies or need extra time, OVS makes it possible to learn in a way that works best for you.

I highly recommend OVS to anyone looking for a flexible and effective learning experience!

I took Advanced Functions (MHF4U) at Ontario Virtual School and had a great experience. My teacher, Mr. Currie, provided helpful feedback and made clear corrections on tests, which really improved my understanding. The lessons were easy to follow, making the material much more approachable. I also appreciated the flexibility of the course, allowing me to complete it in just three months at my own pace. Overall, I highly recommend OVS for anyone looking for a smooth and effective learning experience.

I took grade 12 english course in OVS and this remote studying style fits my learning style as I could always watch the videos again to fully understand the course. Unlike day school, I have the ability to fully control the learning speed of the course which led to my decision to choose OVS. Overall, my teacher responded to my questions fast and his explanations were helpful to structure my essays properly, which resulted in high 90s for my final mark!

I had a great experience taking ENG4U with Ontario Virtual School. My teacher, as well as the staff there, were very supportive. Any questions I had were answered quickly, and the evaluations were marked promptly. My marks were posted on OUAC promptly, usually within less than 48 hours, which allowed universities to get back to me quickly. I would recommend OVS to students, especially those in Grade 12 that want an easier workload.

My name is Abdulla and I took Advanced Functions 4U. When I first heard about OVS I thought it was just an easy mark booster for any course but I later found out that it was a very well designed program that helps students learn in their own way. The thing that I liked the most about OVS was the fact I was able to study however I wanted, whenever I wanted, and wherever I wanted. The flexibility and freedom I was given was so great and it helped me get such I high grade in the course I had taken.

I recently completed SCH4U-04 with Ontario Virtual School, and I couldn’t be happier with my experience! The flexibility of the course allowed me to learn at my own pace while still receiving timely feedback from my teacher. I was impressed with how quickly assignments were graded, and the detailed feedback helped me improve throughout the course.

One of the best parts about taking this course at OVS was the availability of practice tests, exams, and online textbooks.

I chose OVS over my regular day school because it gave me the chance to focus on this subject without the pressure of a rigid schedule. The process of submitting work and receiving grades was smooth, and I really appreciated how efficiently my final mark was sent to OUAC for my university applications.

Overall, I highly recommend OVS to any student looking for a high-quality, flexible, and well-structured online learning experience!

I chose OVS instead of my regular day school because I needed a more adaptable schedule, and it turned out to be a great decision. My teacher was responsive and provided clear feedback, and my evaluations were marked quickly. The practice tests and online resources were very helpful in preparing for assessments.

Most importantly, my final mark was posted to OUAC without any issues, ensuring a smooth university application process. I highly recommend OVS to anyone looking for a reliable and efficient e-learning experience!

The best thing about taking a course with OVS was the flexibility. To be able to work at my own pace and to complete assignments on my schedule was quite convenient, especially while trying to juggle other commitments. I decided to take OVS over my regular day school because I wanted to lighten my course load in the semester and still receive the required credit. Also, it allowed me to finish one course much quicker than I had been able to in a physical setting. This teacher was pretty responsive: the questions were answered, and assessments were graded fast. Feedback helped a lot-it was easier to see where exactly the mistake or error was and how to enhance it. Some courses included practice tests and/or exams, plus online textbooks available for studying purposes. The school office and student success team were available when needed and answered questions within a reasonable amount of time. The marks went out easily to OUAC, which helped the students apply with ease to universities. In general, it is a great avenue for self-motivated students who want more flexibility in their studies.

OVS has been a game changer for my learning experience especially in math. I had the opportunity to take advanced functions this semester with OVS and safe to say I have no regrets!! I had initially taken the course at my day school and I found myself struggling to keep up with the pace and the material. Moving to OVS has made a significant impact on my learning and having that time to go over the material at my own pace allowed me to carefully review challenging topics to succeed. The online lessons and the teachers are great sources and were very helpful throughout my journey with OVS this semester and brought back my confidence in math. Overall OVS provided me with a great environment to help me succeed and safe to say that I will be going back to OVS to complete my calculus credit as well!

Hi My name is Hriman and I recently completed the Grade 12 Advanced Functions (MHF4U-13) course through OVS and couldn't be happier with my decision to enroll there! I transitioned from my traditional high school because the instructional methods there did not suit my learning style, which often left me struggling. OVS offered a more supportive virtual environment where help and feedback were readily available and prompt, making the learning process smoother and more understandable.

The course provided numerous practice tests and quizzes, which greatly reduced my anxiety during exams because I was well-prepared and familiar with the material.

As a Grade 12 student applying to universities through OUAC, I was immensely relieved to see my grades quickly and accurately updated in my OUAC profile—a process managed entirely by OVS, sparing me any hassle. Additionally, my grades were automatically shared with my day school, my parents, and my guidance counselor, ensuring everyone was informed and aligned.

Overall, I'm extremely grateful for the educational experience OVS provided. I've already recommended it to three of my friends, all of whom are enjoying their courses there as much as I did.

I just finished my first course with OVS and it was a wonderful experience! I took SCH4U because I was indecisive at my day school and by the time I decided I wanted to take it, it was too late. OVS provides in depth lessons for each unit and despite being asynchronous, it’s very straightforward. I also like having the freedom of doing the work + lessons on my own time. I had Mr Wiebe for Chemistry and he was very accommodating! He would always respond to my many many emails in a timely manner and help me with whatever I needed. They also send your midterm + final report straight to OUAC and your homeschool so it’s not a hassle at all. Definitely recommend OVS to everybody!!!

The best decision i made. OVS lets you work on your own pace until you feel confident enough to write your tests. Also there are many helpful videos which help you learn all the topics needed to be successful for this course. You can message your teacher any time and get great feedback and help. Everything is well structured and helps lead you to the final exam. I would highly recommend any high school student to take this advanced functions math course (MHF 4UO). Its really worth it and simple to follow.

I just completed grade 12 advanced functions with OVS and I’m so happy I chose OVS to gain my credit! I switched out of my regular school as the way the curriculum was being taught, wasn’t beneficial to my learning and found that I struggled more with my day school. I also enjoyed how accessing support and assistance was relatively quick for it being virtual As well as how quickly evaluations were returned with full explanation on errors and steps for improvement.

I also enjoyed the large amount of practice tests and quizzes that were available throughout the course which made the testing periods seem less overwhelming as I had known what I was doing and had practiced more.

As a grade 12 applying through OUAC I was very thankful to know and see myself how quickly my marks were posted into my OUAC Portfolio and grateful that that was not something I had to worry about doing myself. I also enjoyed how my marks were sent to my day school, parents, and guidance counsellor so that everyone was on the same page.

Overall, I’m very thankful to have found OVS and since started I have recommended over three friends to join as well, whom which they all enjoy taking their classes with OVS as well.

My name is Aaron and I took SCH3U (Grade 11 Chemistry), my expectations were pretty low at first as I didn't have much confidence in online schools, but as I started going through the lessons I realized that they were a lot better structured than I was expecting. The lessons were all very engaging and meaningful, they all had an appropriate length and the quiz questions at the end were very useful to help remember what was taught. I would absolutely take another course with OVS if I needed another extra credit, and I would highly recommend it. I would honestly say that it is on par with regular school, if not better because you can work at your own pace. The teacher was also great, she gave good feedback and returned my emails very fast.

The lessons are thorough and easy to follow, with detailed lessons. The quizzes and homework assigned, are beneficial to the learning experience. My teacher, was very helpful and patient with me.

This was my first time taking a class through OVS. I’ve taken an online class before through my day school and found it to be much more difficult to pace myself versus the self paced course that OVS provides. The platform is very easy to navigate so that watching lessons, finding extra resources and submitting work was very simple. The teachers grade work very fast, and the calendar feature helpful for time management to finish the course in the time I wanted to. Overall great experience!

I had a terrible experience with this online private school. I chose online learning because I have responsibilities that make attending in-person school inconvenient. My first course with them went smoothly, but during my second course, they insisted I come in person for the final exam. This completely defeats the purpose of an online school.

Despite explaining my circumstances, the administration, particularly the guy vice principal, was completely unhelpful and dismissive. They showed no understanding or flexibility and ultimately withheld my final grade because I couldn’t attend the exam. To make matters worse, they refused to refund my $600, leaving me with absolutely nothing to show for the time I spent doing the work and money I invested.
This school’s lack of support and empathy for students’ situations is appalling. If you’re considering this school because you think it will accommodate your needs, think again. They clearly don’t care about their students once they have your money. I would never recommend this school to anyone. That’s a good amount of money, and it doesn’t grow on trees. I worked hard to pay for this course, and I expected better.

TERRIBLE! This school is garbage for anyone who wants to learn and do well. All these positive reviews are from fake accounts the school made, just look at their bot profiles. Taking MHF4U and it was not worth the $500+ at all. The lessons barely teach you anything and you're left figuring out how to solve the textbook questions yourself. There is no teacher help whatsoever, I have to rely on tutors and the internet to teach me everything as the lessons have like 5 slides that barely cover the concepts. The teacher only marks the tests and that's it. If that doesn't sound bad enough - about 1/5 of the textbook answers (for the questions) are wrong! I have spoken to the teacher about this and she is trying to get it addressed (she has been nice and this review isn't towards her but rather the school). This is very unacceptable to occur in a course this expensive where students have to rely on answers as all the learning is independent.
It's also a HORRIBLE school if you're trying to apply to university. They have this rule where you can only be given a mark if you have completed 2 units. There are 4 units in this course and unit 1 is already almost half the course. After completing unit 2 you're about 75% through the course not 50%. This has significantly delayed my university application which is not great as I am applying to more competitive programs. Needing to complete that amount of the course before you get any mark whatsoever to use on your transcript is outrageous. How come nobody who works here has thought about this?
Lastly, the only thing that goes towards your mark are your unit tests and exam. The textbook work which makes up all of the course work besides the tests and exam do not go towards anything which is terrible in my opinion as someone can cheat their way through the course in a few days. This really is the only course format I have taken where the work doesn't contribute to the mark and all the hours that you put into it.

This school is just trash and a money absorber. There are much better options for sure. I would not have taken this course with these guys even if it was FREE.

The grading process was fast, and the feedback on assignments was detailed and helpful. The teachers and staff were professional and supportive, making the learning process enjoyable.

The platform is incredibly flexible—you can access, submit, and review your assignments, tests, and lessons anytime you want. There’s so much more I could say, but overall, I highly recommend OVS for anyone looking for a smooth and effective learning experience.

I chose OVS for MHF4U-20 because of the flexibility it offers in pacing and scheduling. It was my fourth course with OVS, and I must say, the experience exceeded my expectations. The platform's modern approach to learning and the ability to work independently were highly appealing. I would absolutely consider taking yet another course with OVS. The structure and support made the experience engaging and manageable. Compared to my day school courses, the OVS course had well-organized materials and a clear layout. The teachers were accessible providing detailed feedback and assistance whenever I needed it. The online format also meant I could revisit lessons or resources as often as I liked, which isn't always possible in a traditional classroom.
To stay on track and finish the course on time, I used careful planning and the calendar feature. The built-in reminders were useful in setting goals and keeping myself accountable. As I am under 18, my parents utilized their portal access to monitor my progress. This feature ensured that they were aware of my achievements and deadlines, which helped them provide timely support when necessary.
Overall, MHF4U-20 at OVS was a fantastic experience. It combined quality education with flexibility and innovative tools, making it an excellent choice for independent learners.

My experience with OVS was through studying in Mr. Hughes's calculus class, I choose OVS because it was recommended to me by my guidance counselor as an alternative option because all of the other calculus online classes were full. Calculus was the first class I have ever done with OVS and I can honestly say that the course is very well organized and the teacher is very flexible, and supportive, it was great being able to work at my own pace and decide when I'm ready to write tests, on that note Mr Hughes is very quick with his marking which is another thing I really appreciate about him, during regular school the period between having taken a test and waiting for your marks to arrive can be very excruciating but I never felt that in this class as Mr Hughes would always be very quick to hand back the test, I'm basically done highschool but if I were to go back I would have done at least 2-3 more courses with OVS.

I have loved my experience with OVS- the teachers are so responsive and supportive, you can ask questions and they are happy to help and they mark assignments quickly. The platform is easy to use. I took a few courses through OVS and some with ILC and the difference was night and day. I would never waste my time with ILC again, OVS has been unbelievable and would recommend - worth paying a little more to avoid all the frustration and lack of support that comes with ILC

I completed grade 12 chemistry with Ontario Virtual School and had an amazing experience. Initially I was worried about time management, but using the calendar tool I was able to set deadlines for myself and make sure I stayed on task. I really enjoyed this class and the interactive elements, the virtual labs were fun to complete, and easy to follow. I highly recommend taking a course through OVS, as it was one of the best classes I have taken in person or online.

I took AVI3M0 with Ms. Mackenzie. Since the pandemic, I generally like to stay away from online courses. However, this made me change my opinion. Not only could I work at my own pace and practice my creativity in the course, my teacher was very helpful and supportive, always responding within ~24 hours to my emails. It offered much more freedom compared to in-person school, which helped me excercise my time management and independance. To any students who are looking to enroll, I highly recommend it.

The OVS provided a fantastic learning experience that strongly supported my success in ENG 3U. I chose OVS because it provided flexibility with scheduling and completing coursework. With a busy in-person course load and work/volunteer commitments, I needed to ensure I could spend the time on ENG 3U during the summer and evening hours. The program helped me balance school and other commitments. The calendar feature and layout of the online course was easy to use and the ability to modify due dates or submit assignments early was helpful. The teacher provided immediate and helpful feedback and email correspondence with my parents was also timely and useful. The preparation provided for the final exam was also helpful in ensuring my success on that exam. Overall, I am very happy with my experience and highly recommend the program!

My name is Fatima (Helia) Sayadnasab and I took ENGU4-06 with OVS!

I chose Ontario Virtual School (OVS) because of its flexibility and reputation for providing high-quality courses. This was my first course with OVS, and I’m extremely satisfied with the experience. The course materials were well-organized, and the layout made it easy to follow each lesson. Compared to my day school courses, I found the OVS course to be more structured and engaging, with interactive resources that kept me motivated.

My teacher was incredibly supportive and responsive, offering personalized feedback that helped me understand complex topics in depth. I appreciated the level of attention and support, which is not always easy to get in a traditional classroom setting.

I used the calendar feature to set up a study plan and keep track of assignment deadlines. This helped me manage my time effectively and stay on track to complete the course at my desired pace. It was a great tool to stay organized and focused on my goals.

As a minor, my parents used their portal access to monitor my progress, and they found it very helpful to see updates and grades in real-time. Although I didn’t try the gamification feature this time, I think it’s a creative way to make learning more fun and competitive.

Overall, I had a fantastic experience with OVS, and I would definitely consider taking another course with them in the future. Highly recommend!

My child is completing a course with OVS. I would recommend OVS for only the most self-motivated students with strong written communication skills. My child is having difficulty with the course material and there is basically no support. Questions must be sent by email, which isn't really the best format for every learner. Any email has about a two day response time, which deserves 2 stars alone. It has been almost a year since the course started, and I have only received grade updates from the teacher, and one email from OVS offering help to make a work schedule for completion. I would say that OVS is best suited for upgrading. Do your kid a favour and say no to OVS.
\*In response to the OVS response, I would say that my child's grades at any normal school would have resulted in an intervention from the school and teacher - not the parent having to advocate. I did reach out to the teacher to request additional assistance, and they suggested the student do more practice tests and email the teacher questions. They stated that 1:1 help is not available. If these two static methods of learning are not your child's strengths, then OVS is not a good fit.

I recently took SBI3U (Biology) course from OVS. This was my first course I had done at OVS. At first, I was leaning towards other virtual schools, but OVS had the most reviews with good ratings. I can now say this has to be the best choice I have made. I wanted to get SBI3U done in summer so I could have a lighter course load for the school year ahead and now that I am done, a lot of stress is lifted off my shoulders. I would definitely take another course with OVS as my experience with my teacher, course work, and homework was genuinely impeccable. My OVS teacher would mark my work so quick and give precise feedback that really helped me to improve on my answers. To add to this, the planning feature on OVS was so useful like I am so serious because usually in day schools, teacher's plan everything and as a student, planning everything on your own may be difficult so the calendar planner was so effective. Lastly, OVS has to have one of the best interfaces I have ever seen on any other online school as it did not look boring and was very easy to use. Honestly, OVS Biology was the best decision I made and now I can relax while everyone is doing Biology at my day school.

The resources were super helpful as well. My only issue is that reaching out for help is never reliable. It takes up to 24 hours for a response, even during office hours. If you’re taking a course here to earn a credit quickly, you’ll have to be accountable for any issues or questions you may have. I ended up clarifying many questions with my actual high school teacher once I returned to school. Overall, I would take a course through Ontario virtual school again, however I’d be more aware of external resources that I’d potentially need to find and use.

I took HSP3U through Ontario Virtual School in order fulfill a prerequisite for my in-person school. It was my first time taking an OVS course, and it will not be my last. One of the things I loved the most was that my parents could track my progress and keep themselves informed. But Ms. Mackenzie, my teacher, was the real motivation behind my success. She was always available when I needed help, consistently motivated and pushed me to excel, and graded my work in less than 10 hours. This quick feedback helped me better understand the expectations and improve my performance. Thanks to Ms. Mackenzie’s excellent teaching, I achieved a 99% in this class. I highly recommend taking courses with OVS if you're looking for a supportive and effective online learning experience.

I took FSF3U over the summer so I could take Grade 12 French at my day school in September. This was my first course with OVS (and my first online course in general), so I wasn't sure what to expect, but the resources that the OVS site offered made navigating the pages really easy. I especially liked how I could see all the lessons without needing to "unlock" them, and that let me plan my time depending on the anticipated length/difficulty of lessons and assignments. My teacher responded to my emails in a timely manner (within 2 days) and also answered any questions I had, which really made me feel prepared for the final exam. Overall, learning with OVS was a great experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to take additional courses outside of school 🙂

I was impressed by how well-structured the course was, and I found the teachers and materials to be on par with, if not better than, my day school experiences. The layout was intuitive, and the support was excellent.

The ability to set my own pace was a huge advantage. I used the calendar feature regularly, which helped me stay on track and meet my target deadlines.

I would absolutely recommend OVS to anyone!

I originally learned about Ontario Virtual School through advertisements and through family. I chose OVS to complete courses I couldn't have in my day school. The first course that I completed through OVS was TGJ3M where I learned about the usage of technology and the evolution of it, this peaked my interest as I enjoy technology a bunch. The second course I completed was Advanced Functions (MHF4U) which was a relevant course for me. The layout of the course was extremely easy to digest as there were specific lessons for the different units within the course. This ensured that I was able to follow along and understand all the underlying material required for the unit tests. My teacher was clear, coherent and responsive on topics that I felt were more challenging. All in all, I would say I am extremely satisfied with my experiences at OVS and would definitely complete another course.

Over the summer of grade 12 I completed MCV4U-19 with OVS after realizing that my own province didn't offer any summer courses, and I needed it in order to not delay my future university course sequence.
The course itself was well organized and although the teacher doesn't teach the course themselves, they respond to emails and grade assignments in an timely manner. Many resources were offered to help me succeed with this course, my favourite and most useful feature I used on the website is the calendar and course planner. It helped me stay on track with my assignments as well as arrange days where I could still hang out with my friends in the summer. Overall, it was as good of an experience as I could've expected for my academics and I managed to complete it in a month and a half with a good mark.

Firstly, the quick marking time was a standout feature. I was consistently impressed by how fast my assignments and tests were graded, often within just a few days. This speedy feedback was incredibly motivating and allowed me to keep progressing through the material without unnecessary delays.The customer service at Ontario Virtual School is also top-notch.

My first course with Ontario Virtual School was Introduction to Anthropology, Psychology, and Sociology (HSP3U) in Grade 11. My choice was the best that I could have chosen for my academic career! I decided to enroll in an OVS course since my older sister loved it and I needed the extra credits for high school. The information was thought-provoking, captivating, and enlightening. I discovered that I was eager to learn the given knowledge. Ms. Mackenzie, my teacher, was amazing; she marked my papers in less than 24 hours, was always quick to respond to my emails, and was always so motivating. My teacher wanted me to succeed. Compared to an in-person school, I preferred Ontario Virtual School because I could complete the course at my own speed, from anywhere at any time. Navigating the system was simple and the assignments were clear and fulfilling. I would recommend Ontario Virtual School to anyone looking to get ahead and take interesting courses.

With no other plans over the summer, I thought it would be a great idea, though I doubted my organizing skills. My parents supported and motivated me with the promise of a surprise trip if I finished the course quickly. It worked!
The structure is similar to a day school, but the advantage is seeing the entire course upfront so you know what to expect. You can finish faster if you stay organized. My teacher was great and usually responded within 48 hours.
I’m planning to take another course after our trip.
Highly recommended!

I remember when I was stressed out because I had to find an institution that offered this course. So, during my research, this school seemed to be the best option in terms of the variety of courses and Google reviews, and I visited their website for further information. fortunately, the description was very organized, and I got a background from the outline of the computer science course. Once I took the course the teacher emailed me and introduced the inherent of this course. Also, the website was well-organized and included a planner that updates you on your daily or weekly goals. Moreover, my teacher consistently responded to my emails, questions, and assignments in less than 24 hours, providing thorough and detailed responses.

I took the MHF4U Advance function course last year at OVS as a mature student. Although it took me a year to finish this course (as i had other prior commitments that began at the same time i took this course and also because i was travelling a lot since I took this course). But my overall experience at OVS was exceptionally good. My teacher was Mr. Currie. He was helpful and reviewed all my Unit tests with utmost productive feedback, which eventually helped me in writing my final exam with full confidence. I already have a master's degree in chemistry from India, so going back to studying mathematics was quite challenging in the beginning ngl, but the whole course was designed for success at every step with quizzes after each lesson, Unit tests, interactive eBooks, mock tests and exams for self-improvement etc. were super helpful. I scored 90% overall and i feel so motivated now that i am contemplating of taking another course, MCV4U in future.
I highly recommend OVS to mature students like me who are from life-science background and would want to study Mathematics in future. Highly Recommend OVS.

I chose OVS for my course because of its flexibility and comprehensive curriculum. This was my first course with OVS, and I found the experience very rewarding. The course materials were thorough and easy to understand, and the teacher were responsive and helpful. Compared to my day school courses, the OVS course offered more detailed materials and a user-friendly layout. I would highly recommend taking OVS for your courses.

I was very nervous as to how this course would go because I would have to teach myself but I never felt that, the videos were so informative and understandable and offered a variety of questions to work with that helped me prepare for the homework and tests the resources were very helpful, and easy to use. I cannot recommend OVS enough. I am now more confident than ever I feel as though I have a great grasp of my subject and I’m prepared to move forward.

I recently completed MCV4U, with the Ontario Virtual Schools, and all I can say was I had a stellar experience. There where instructional videos provided, textbook practice questions and answers, a useful math helper, and a teacher that replies almost instantly to any questions or concerns that you have. The tests are graded within 48 hrs. which is exceptional, and the teacher also offers provides feedback. Overall I had a wonderful time, and would 100% recommend this to everyone.

Taking SBI4U - Grade 12 Biology through an online virtual school has been an exceptional experience. The engaging and well-structured teaching style made complex concepts accessible, with interactive multimedia resources and clear explanations catering to different learning styles. The flexibility to revisit lectures and the inclusion of virtual labs added a hands-on experience that enhanced my understanding. The tests were challenging yet fair, emphasizing critical thinking and application of concepts with a variety of question types. Overall, the course offered an enjoyable and effective learning journey, and I highly recommend it to anyone aiming to excel in biology.

This year is my first year with OVS. I chose OVS because I struggled to focus in school with subjects, and teachers tend to cramp everything. It is organized well and has all the help and tools you need I took grade 11 chemistry and passed with an extremely high mark. the teacher was amazing. She did an amazing job with trying to help me. she marked things right away. I finished my course within 3-4 weeks and am onto biology next. My parents had full-on mark updates which they loved. Overall, I would strongly recommend it to anyone interested in this. I am happy I got to experience this right now and continue in the future.

I chose OVS in order to satisfy certain university requirements I could not find in my institution.

I have just finished SCH3U (11th grade chemistry) and my experience has been amazing!

I completed the whole course in about a month, studying roughly 4 hours a day.
Virtual classes are very comprehensible and each class provides you with practice homework so the information can actually be analyzed.

My teacher was great. She responded to my requests and marked evaluations in less than a day normally.

I am now going to continue with SCH4U (12th grade Chemistry).
I feel confident that OVS will help me achieve the highest grades having the best assistance out there!

I completed the english course at the grade 12 level ENG4U with OVS recently and to say the truth, it was a great experience. I chose OVS because honestly I heard a lot of good things about it from my classmates and people in my school in general, my guidance counsellor recommended it to me as well. Even though I have graduated highschool, if I had the chance I would take another course with OVS.

My assigned teacher would mark my work in exactly 3 days and gave me excellent feedback to improve my work which was extremely helpful to reach high marks on the assignments. This was a new experience for me taking an online course with OVS, but I honestly believe that it taught me the importance of managing my time efficiently. Even though there is not a deadline (except for the midterms and final report card deadlines) I felt responsible for making my own deadlines and meeting them, the calendar feature on the website helped with that as well in reminding me what tasks I have to complete for the week.

Here are tips for upcoming students who will be taking a course(s) with OVS:
1- Manage your time!
2- DO NOT PROCRASTINATE!!
3- Communicate with your teacher with your goals at the beginning of the course
4- Do the work yourself

I recently completed a course on the ovs platform and found it was very smooth and functional. The layout was easy to understand. They give you a rundown on how to use everything from the very beginning and your able to go back and reference it as needed. The instructor was fast with the replies and grading everything was within the time they allow for responses. I found the lessons kept me engaged and explained lessons in a way i could understand. You can also go back and re watch lessons as you need. I enjoyed the course so much i signed on for another and i think i may do one more after this one. You can also work at your own pace and have 1 calender year to finish each course so plenty of time if things come up. 9/10 experience so far.

I recently completed a MHF4U course with Ontario Virtual School and I couldn't be more pleased with my experience. The platform is incredibly user-friendly and the course materials were comprehensive and engaging. As someone who always struggled in math and sciences, this platform made me realize that it is not the material that is challenging but the way I choose to learn it. I went from averaging in the 60-70s throughout High school to a 94 average within the 4 months of taking this course.

I am amazed by how clear and organized the course material is. The content is structured in a way that makes learning both straightforward and enjoyable. Each lesson builds on the last, ensuring a solid understanding of the subject matter.

The flexibility that is offered is also a major plus, allowing me to learn at my own pace and fit my studies around my busy schedule.

Overall, my experience with Ontario Virtual School has been exceptional. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a quality online education.

Course I took: BOH4M
Name: Jessica

I wish I found out about this sooner! I was looking for another course to take during my school year, but didn't want to take night school in fear that it would interrupt my normal academic performance.

A friend recommended online private schooling, and I started looking into it. OVS was the best fit for me because it allowed me to learn at my own pace. I was a bit confused how it worked as would I be learning without a teacher? But the whole platform is designed nicely where I always have access to support within 24 hours.

I would definetly recommend OVS to someone looking to take extra courses but needs flexibility. I love how you can finish the course in either a month, or leisurly complete it in a year.

It is definetly a tool that I feel like highschool students should look into if they want to earn a specific credit or learn a course.

With only a limited amount of courses able to be selected in-person, I feel like OVS opens up a wide range of possibilities, and I can learn anything I want to.

I completed my first course with OVS in 4U English and I really enjoyed it. I graduated from high school this year, but I still highly recommend OVs to all high school students as it is way more flexible than a day school. You can do your assignments anytime and anywhere. The most special thing about OVS courses is that there are no deadlines, so you can submit your assignments without rushing. This allows you to perform better and get high marks. Also, the teachers are very supportive and respond quickly to questions.

I really loved doing my course on OVS, it helped boost my grade 12 chemistry mark because I was able to do it at my own pace and learn it accordingly. I definitely recommend doing a course especially when it requires more practice.

I recently completed an online course on food and nutrition. The course content covered various aspects of food and nutrition, including dietary guidelines, nutrition importance, and its impact on health. It provided a good overview of the subject matter and the work helped me gain more knowledge.

Name : Muhammet Dulger
Course : SPH4U

Why did you choose OVS for the course, and was it your first course with OVS?

I chose OVS for my Grade 12 Physics course because of the flexibility it offered. This was my first course with OVS, and I was impressed by the positive reviews and the detailed course descriptions provided on their website.

Would you take another course with OVS?

Yes, I would definitely take another course with OVS. The experience was smooth, and the flexibility allowed me to balance my studies with other responsibilities.

How did the OVS course compare with your day school courses in terms of teachers, course materials, layout, etc.?

The OVS course was comparable to my day school courses in terms of quality. The teachers were knowledgeable and responsive, the course materials were comprehensive and well-organized, and the layout was user-friendly. I found it easy to navigate through the course content and assignments.

How did you manage your time to finish the course when you wanted? Did you use the calendar feature to help your planning?

I managed my time by setting a study schedule and sticking to it. The calendar feature was particularly helpful in planning my study sessions and keeping track of deadlines. It ensured that I stayed on top of my coursework and finished the course on time.

Did your parent use their portal access to monitor and support your learning (if less than 18 years old)?

As I am over 18, my parents did not need to use the portal access. However, I appreciated the option being available for younger students as it can be a great support system.

Did you try the gamification feature to challenge other students to a review quiz competition?

Yes, I did try the gamification feature. It was a fun and engaging way to review the course material. Competing with other students in quiz competitions added an element of excitement to the learning process and reinforced my understanding of the concepts.

I recently completed Calculus (MCV4U) with the Ontario Virtual School and I saw it as a great experience. Calculus was the first course I took with the Ontario Virtual School and as a first impression, this was a great experience. The teachers are helpful with their support and fast response times in addition to the course material being fun and easy to follow. The guided examples and thorough explanations helped me grasp hard concepts in Calculus and the homework was well guided to work on at my own flexibility. To further manage my time, the lessons were arranged in a helpful format that allowed me to manage my time with day school work and Virtual School work. Overall, I would take another course with the Ontario Virtual School and would recommend it to other students wanting a great experience while learning.

I took Biology Grade 12 as my in-person teacher did not teach well and it wouldn't prepare me properly for university but once i took a course from OVS (Biology grade 12). It was great, the material is condensed and easy to understand. Good amount of time for tests so you wont stress out and so many videos to watch and understand it, my teacher (Who was assigned to me) always responded on time for my questions. Would recommend!

OVS Was my first e-learning course and I chose challenge and change. It was an excellent experience and I enjoy the "learn/work at your own pace model that they have" I would recommend, and will be recommending OVS to anyone who enjoys learning at their own pace. My teacher was very responsive, often times even outside of the listed office hours. She was very kind and helpful. I learned a lot in the course overall, and had a great experience.

I was able to finish the course at my own pace and hand things in when time was right for me with my busy high school schedule. The teacher was incredible, always highlighting my skills and what I could work on every time I handed things back. I would recommend OVS to anyone thinking about thinking about an online course!

It plans out your work and lessons accordingly based on what days youre busy, and when you want to finish the course by. Loved it overall!

I was unsure at first about how much I’d actually be learning, but honestly it was filled with useful information in my course. I expected there to just be notes for me to memorize, but luckily there was an actual teacher reading off from a presentation which was surprising. The website is very easy to navigate, and I never had any issues. Something that I really enjoyed is that there was a game that I could play with other students in my course to help review for upcoming tests!

As someone who doesn't post many reviews, I had to make one for OVS (Ontario Virtual School) because it is deserving.

I had doubts whether I should take an OVS course as I wasn't familiar to how it works. Its safe to say its worth the price. The quality is incredible and the fact that it allows you to work at your own pace is a 5-star of its own.

I took the MHF4U course (advanced functions) because in my day school, the teachers flew through all the lessons incredibly fast and it was affecting my day to day schedule to the point where my other classes started to see drops in grades. For OVS, all of the lessons were prerecorded, meaning I could always go back and rewatch a particular lesson I wasn't sure about. On the topic of lessons, I could watch them at any point of the day which allowed me to have more flexibility in my schedule.

OVS is user friendly, similar to how Brightspace works. It provided me with online textbooks and material, as well as my personal favorite, Practice tests.

The teacher I had was incredibly nice, giving me tips for improvement and guidance.

Overall I am beyond satisfied! If I were to take another online course, OVS would be my first choice!

My son chose to take an academic English course with the Ontario Virtual School. The course was extremely well laid out with 8 different units. Activities and tasks were very well explained with clear expectations. The teacher gave clear instructions and was very timely with her feedback. The freedom of having no timelines was beneficial for my son so he could schedule his other coursework and his hours for his student job better. It allowed him to judge when it was best for him to hand in work with no added stress. The website is straightforward to navigate also. I would definitely recommend The Ontario Virtual School.

I took english with OVS and it was my first ovs class ever taken. I took this class because i felt my public school english class was setting its students up for failure rather than success. The ovs teacher was motivating and the course was extremely organized. There are various lessons that clearly explain the content. Because of this clarity i was able to complete my work with little questions or support. Whatever support i did need my teacher quickly replied. The teachers here actually care about helping student succeed and that has to be my favourite thing about this program. If i wasnt graduating i would absolutely take another class here. This has boosted my academic confidence. The system also has a calendar, you state how long you want to finish the course in and it effectively organizes all your work and lessons. I used this as my motivation. I realized without clear deadlines it would be much harder for me to stay organized and ahead in my work. Overall this was a 10/10 experience and i wish public schools taught just as well as OVS.

Not only was it easy to navigate, but it was incredibly informative and the teacher was quick to respond and very informed on the material! I found OVS when I was incredibly stressed about not being able to graduate, and OVS made everything so much easier! I finished the course within a month, with a final grade of 93%, and my only regret is not finding OVS before my final semester of high school. I cannot recommend OVS enough, thank you so much for everything!

I recently completed a calculus course with Ontario Virtual School, and I couldn't be happier with the experience. The flexible schedule allowed me to learn at my own pace, which was crucial for me to grasp the challenging concepts in calculus. The teachers were incredibly supportive and responsive, always available to answer questions and provide detailed explanations. The course materials were well-organized and easy to follow, making it less intimidating to tackle complex topics. Thanks to their comprehensive and student-friendly approach, I was able to achieve a good passing grade. I highly recommend Ontario Virtual School to anyone looking for a supportive and effective online learning environment.

I am so glad a friend introduced OVS to me after sharing my frustration of acquiring prerequisite to further my education. I am more than satisfied now…..it’s a well structured online School where you get to plan your time well, have all the resources available for a specific course and most of all the teachers are welcoming, supportive and guides you to a successful completion. Am definitely selling OVS to all my family & friends 👍

I took ENG4U through Ontario virtual school. I found the course material more challenging than my day school. This better prepared me for university and made me more confident in my ability. My teacher was Mr. Escobar, he was extremely helpful and marked all of my assignments promptly. The only negative thing I have to say is that I found some aspects in the class novel to be inappropriate. Overall I am so glad I chose to do online school through OVS.

I recently completed Grade 12 Physics SPH4U with Ontario Virtual School. This was my first course with OVS, and I went into it very nervous about not being able to talk face to face with my teacher. But my teacher, Ms. Vanderkamp, was absolutely lovely and answered all of my emails in an extremely timely manner and with very helpful and useful explanations of my questions. In terms of time management, I did some of the course every weekday (some days 45 minutes, some two hours) for about 4 months. The calendar feature where I was able to plan out what lessons to do when was extremely helpful.
The one thing I would change is that some of the course resources (practice tests etc) are a bit outdated and contain material that is no longer in the curriculum, which was a bit confusing for me, but when I emailed my teacher to ask about it she was very helpful in clearing up what I would and wouldnt be tested on and where to find alternative resources.

If you are someone who is looking for somewhere to take a course asynchronously, I would say OVS is a very strong choice.

At first I was a little hesitant due to my ability to learn online, but with the lessons and videos I had a great understanding throughout my entire course and had a great time! My teacher continued to respond quickly to my emails which was great and I also got my marks back on time! I have recommended this to many people and will continue to recommend this to friends and family!

My experience completing Grade 12 English with OVS was amazing! My teacher consistently provided support when I had inquiries and he was able to push me to achieve an amazing mark. I was able to submit all my work to receive feedback before final submissions, this allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the course content and have higher accomplishments. Managing my course was easy as the layout of the course was straight-forward and efficient. Overall, a great experience.

I took the Grade 12 Human Growth and Development throughout the Lifespan (HHG4M), which was my first course with Ontario Virtual School. My decision was the best decision I made for my academics! It was by far one of my favourite courses that I have taken throughout high school. The content was challenging, interesting, and eye-opening. I found myself excited to learn the lessons provided. My teacher was incredible, always answering my emails efficiently and marking my assignments within twenty four hours. I enjoyed Ontario Virtual School, in comparison to in person school, because I was able to finish the course at my own pace, wherever and whenever I wanted to. I finished the course in a month which would defiantly not happen in person. The system was easy to navigate, tests were clear, and assignments were interesting. I would recommend Ontario Virtual School to anyone looking to get ahead and take interesting courses.

My first impression of Ontario Virtual School (OVS) was fantastic. I heard great things and decided to switch from my home school. Taking Grade 12 Advanced Functions with a wonderful teacher helped me a lot. They were supportive and helped me reach my goals.

But things changed when I took Grade 12 Calculus and Vectors. My new teacher wasn't as helpful or understanding. It made it hard for me to do well in the class.

I tried talking to the admissions office about it. They said I could retake the exam at the OVS office to improve my grade. But when I explained that I live far away and don't have transportation, they weren't very helpful. They just told me to use public transit, which isn't easy for me, especially as a young girl.

Feeling disappointed by their response and lack of understanding, In the future I won't be taking OVS anymore. And I can't recommend it to my friends anymore either.

Highly recommend on Ontario Virtual School, very knowledgeable and supportive teacher for my son’s MHF4U-14 course. He received high mark in this course and the teacher, Ms.Hargraves was always there for him to guide and answer all his questions. The concept is very straight forward and once you study the success is accomplished. Very well organized course and easy to navigate the online system. If you’re looking to improve your mark or just take a course to gain your credit, OVS is your place!

I had a remarkable experience with Ontario Virtual School! The course I enrolled in was the Grade 11 Introductory course to Anthropology, Psychology, and Sociology (HSP3U-02) with Ms. Milano as my teacher. It was my initial experience with a fully independent study format, yet the instructional videos and available office hours facilitated a very effective learning process. Ms. Milano was consistently available to address any questions and guide me through any difficulties with the material, always providing clear and thorough explanations. Despite the course's independent format, the material was current and structured in a way that promoted student success. Being able to easily reach out to my instructor for quick responses to questions, clarifications, or feedback was incredibly beneficial. The course assessments were diverse, and designed to enhance understanding and encourage critical thinking and in-depth research. Ms. Milano made sure I fully grasped the content before any evaluations. The administration at Ontario Virtual School was equally impressive, providing exceptional support to ensure students received the utmost benefit from their studies. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Ontario Virtual School and will surely recommend it to others. My thanks go out for all the support and resources provided.

It was great taking English ENG4U with OVS. This being my first time taking an online class, I was pleasantly surprised on how good it was. I had much more flexibility to work on my assignments, as I was very busy trying to manage work, school and more. I feel as thought the material I learned was much more in depth than what I would've in my day school. And a big difference between OVS and my day school is how rapid I got my assignments back. After submitting, it would take max two days to receive a grade most of the time it took one day.

"My experience with this course at OVS school was fantastic and served as my introduction to online education. I discovered OVS through a recommendation from a friend, and I'm genuinely grateful for their suggestion. I'm already contemplating enrolling in more courses offered by OVS in the future.

The organization and structure of the course were impeccable, providing clear guidance on what was expected every step of the way. The teachers acted as exemplary role models and offered excellent support throughout. Compared to my experience in traditional day school settings, the setup here was not only more efficient but also facilitated a conducive learning environment.

The course's flexibility was a standout feature for me. Utilizing the calendar allowed me to establish a daily schedule tailored to my needs and set a timeline for completing the course. Additionally, the opportunity to engage in friendly competition and collaboration with fellow students enhanced my learning experience, leading to better comprehension and retention of the material.

Overall, my time with OVS has been incredibly rewarding, and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a well-organized, supportive, and engaging online learning experience."

It allowed for a flexible form of learning as I worked through my own pace and it was very easy to manage.

Moving forward, I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a more comfortable and flexible form of learning, while still aiming for a high tier education.

I was having trouble submitting my Exam to my teacher, and he helped me throughout the process flawlessly. I would recommend this course.

My schedule in school was very busy. I had huge course loads, stress, and I wasn't happy as much. Then I came across Ontario virtual school. At first I was very scared to take it because I didn't know how it would work, but I took it for advanced functions. I can now tell you it was my best decision. I had less work load because I finished the work on my own time. Also the teachers were very helpful and would help you and get back to you as soon as possible. For me this course was one of my best decisions.

I came to Canada from China and attended Grade 11 last year. However, I need more credits to graduate on time. After counseling my guidance, I chose OVS. I had Grade 10 science in OVS last year and got a high mark! So I attend SPH3U this year and get a 94, which really satisfies me and I plan to take another course, maybe Grade 12 Chinese, later on.
I once worried that I might not get a good learning experience at OVS, but it turns out that the quality of OVS' teachers and courses are not less than that of my day school. And the course calendar helps a lot too, so I get one credit in 2 months by studying 2-3 hours every week.
And, the most important thing: OVS is much cheaper than other online schools!!!! I used to attend another e-learning school, which cost me about $2000. I just regret not to find OVS earlier.

I recently completed MCV4U-02 through the Ontario Virtual School. This was my first experience with the institution and I can say with certainty that my experience was very positive. My teacher Ms. Bertolo was always quick to provide feedback on evaluations and responding to emails for helping with understanding the course content. The biggest hurdle I overcame early on was managing my time so I could complete the course at a good pace while still acquiring an in-depth understanding of the underlying concepts. Fortunately, the calendar feature was extremely helpful in organizing dedicated time slots to focus on which course to study. The lessons were very well organized and easy to follow with the instructor elaborating on content in the slideshows. Overall, I would wholeheartedly recommend OVS to others and take more courses if provided the opportunity.

About the coursework, the circullum allowed me balance out my own schduele and turn my focus towards any part of the course at any time.

Moving to OVS private school was awesome, especially with the advanced functions course I did. Their flexible way of doing things helped me manage my time better and handle lots of heavy workload at once. I liked how they used videos online instead of just textbooks. Having extra time for assessments/tests really helped me learn, especially because I work better when I'm not rushed. Moreover, the one-year duration of the course made it more manageable alongside a busy life, further solidifying OVS as an excellent choice overall.

I chose OVS after realizing that the teacher at my school was not compatible with my learning style. This was my first time taking a course on OVS and I was nervous to take it going in. I was especially nervous as I was taking MHF4U, and needed it for university.
Looking back on my experience I would, and have, enrolled in another course at OVS.
Compared to my day school, I found the OVS course much more organized and accesible. The resources were all there for me when I needed them and I could access them at anytime that I needed. The teacher I had was quick to respond to any questions I had and quick when it came to marking my tests. This was a welcome change as at school I often had to wait over a week to get my results back.

Overall, my experience with OVS was extremely positive and I won't hesitate to recommend it to my friends.

I choose OVS because my high school didn't offer senior french FSF4U in person. I liked that there were fewer larger assignments in my course rather than many small ones. It felt like there wasn't a ton of course work, but at the same time, I had to put in the time on the assignments and prepping for the exam, which for me is better for learning as I prefer individual self-guided learning. I also liked the forum where I could practice writing and reading french posts from my peers. My teacher was super responsive which was really helpful.

I had a great experience with the HNB4M course from Ontario Virtual School! The layout of the course was easy to adjust to, as it was very straightforward. The content was very engaging and the assignments featured a wide variety of ways to apply my knowledge. The teacher was quick to help whenever I had questions and all my work was marked in a timely manner. I appreciate having this platform accessible, as I have gotten the opportunity to take a course I would not have gotten to study at my day school. Overall, amazing experience! Thanks so much Ontario Virtual School staff.

Teaches erroneously marked me and refused to fix it. Expensive, you can most likely find the same course for free at your local school board (tdsb virtual learning). Students who do well in this course most likely copied the test that are posted online because teachers the do not answer questions and are unreasonable with legit learners. Most comments are A.I Generated, as you can see by their grammar, punctuation and sentence structure.Despite getting a 98 in my calculus course (just before the exam), I decided to attend a real school where teachers go to work in the morning, instead of working from at home - Possible in the pyjamas - or on vacation (So I got an email). The teachers may point you to the wrong sections of the course to answer your questions, will reply with hostility if they don't like you and if you were thinking of completing the course in under a month like advertised, good luck because there are over 30 lectures. All this to mention, the question I did get wrong was correct logically and if I cheated like every other student who attends this program I would have achieved a 100. Compare yourself with the competition, it's not creditable in my opinion and not recommended by the best universities.

When I compared my day school experiences with OVS courses, I discovered that OVS was just as engaging, if not more so. The instructors were well-informed and constantly willing to assist. The web style was simple to use, and the course contents were organized and easy to follow. Because of this, the learning process was entertaining in addition to instructive. I would 100% recommend signing up if you are considering it.

I used the calendar feature to manage my lessons and tests. My mom was able to support me as emails and test marks went to her. I used the gamification feature which allowed me to challenge my peers to a review quiz competition. Highly recommend Ontario Virtual School.

I took the course, "HFC3M-01 Food and Culture,” as my first online course to get my Ontario-approved school credit for grade 11.

I had a lot going on when I took the course, but found the calendar to help me know what deadlines I should apply when working, and what a reasonable time to finish looked like.

As a homeschooled student, I often have to figure things out on my own and research my answers, so the access to complete and detailed instructions, resources, and a teacher who would consistently get back to me within 24 hours was extremely helpful.

The lessons were engaging, with a variety of materials to accommodate all learning styles, such as videos and news articles. In addition, the course assignments pushed me to thoroughly research and learn the material. Through this, I learned a lot about other cultures and more about Canadian culture. I would happily take another course from OVS, with the opportunity to explore and take advantage of the other features I didn’t use or wasn't aware of.

I took Computer Science - ICS4U with OVS and was happy with my experience. Overall, I really like the independent learning style that OVS provides, it really goes well with my own learning style. The course itself covered relevant materials, and the teacher's feedback was fairly helpful and always in a timely manner. The assignments and tests were also always marked within a timely manner. Overall, I had a good experience with OVS and would recommend it to anyone interested in taking their courses.

Very happy with OVS’ administration because our questions were addressed timely with clarity and professionalism. We are even more impressed with our son’s SCH4U course. He has not taken any online course until now and he is learning so much more with OVS. Not only he is able to review all course contents and videos as many times as he requires, but also has an amazing chemistry teacher who helps him grasp chemistry concepts with ease. Highly recommended!

PLEASE READ!!!!!Would give a 0 if I could. If your looking for professionalism do not come to this school. The staff are as useful as fast food workers. I complained to the staff regarding that there was a mistake in the teachers marking on the tests. When I talked to the teacher first she was very difficult to communicate with, so I went and talked to the staff and they were also very reluctant. All I asked for was another teacher to mark it, or to redo. They were also uncooperative in that sense. So I asked to talk to the Principal and I wrote him and email. He answered "here is my VP go talk to him in that matters." He was as useful as a glass hammer. So I emailed the VP and asked if he could call me. Here he comes and I give him the issue and you know what he says "I dont wanna hear it" "excuse me are you a VP" I said, yes I was as astonished as you. He said what do you want me to do I said can I rewrite it or have another teacher mark it. He said yes you can rewrite in person "I dont know why its called a virtual school if I have to do it in person". I said I cant do that I live in another city. He said I can give you a refund. " I was speechless this guy said he wants to give me a refund the day before midterms are due for university's and my course is a pre req." Absolutely absurd I said to my self "well I guess you gotta accept the loss" but I don't stop there I said "Im going to complain to the Ministry of Education" his tone of voice and the words he was speaking was unacceptable. He said and listen to this part you think your talking to a Vice principal "Remember Im the one who could ruin your career here" "What" I said "Are you even a VP' and I closed the phone. Ten minutes later some person called me from OVS and gave me a 3 percent boost. Which I was absolutely fine cause I calculated there was 2-3% error in the teachers marking. But there was no need to do all that drama with the Admin. I am writing this 1 yr after I wrote this course cause I was absolutely frightened because I thought he was genuinely going to do that. But im not scared anymore here I am telling my story. Do I recommend this school No. Is it cheaper than other schools Yes. But is it worth the $100-$200 saving for the Headaches No. DO NOT GO TO THIS SCHOOL.

Hi there I am Goleo,

I wanted to tell you about my great experience with Ontario Virtual School (OVS) and invite you to do the same after taking my grade 12 advanced functions course. Comparing OVS courses with my day school experiences, I found OVS to be equally, if not more, engaging. The teachers were knowledgeable and always ready to help. The course materials were well-structured and easy to follow, and the online layout was intuitive. This made the learning experience not only educational but enjoyable.

I retook Calculus and Vectors with this school, and I am extremely happy with my overall experience. The teacher and admin team were always very quick with feedback and inquiries, tests and assignments were always handed back within the following day. I highly recommend using this school over other options if you are interested in taking or retaking mandatory courses for university. I loved being able to go at my own pace and complete my assessments whenever I found the time. Overall very easy to incorporate into your day to day routine with a great support team!

Thankfully this school has many resources available in order to help you understand the concepts and equations. I was able to finish in 3 months time, and was able to do it in the comfort of my bedroom. I ended up completing it with a 90% average and I couldn't have been any happier! I'd like to thank my teacher and also the admin for all your spectacular help. This is to the future!

Now my Hope's of pursuing A new hobby is gone in high school as I now have to repay for such an expensive Program. Please do not bring your students into this virtual school. 0/10.

The lessons were well planned and articulated, and the assignments offered a good challenge and applied the learning from the unit. I really liked that there were no deadlines and I got to complete the course on my own time, but I still had the option to set deadlines for myself using the Course Planner.

Overall, I would definitely recommend OVS for anyone looking for an online learning option!

This past year, I completed MCR3U with OVS and I had an overwhelmingly positive experience. I had originally planned to take this course at my day school but due to an error made by administration, I was unable to do so. Initially, I had some concerns completing such a content heavy course on my own. However, I found that the lessons broke down concepts phenomenally. Also, the extra resources provided helped me support my own learning. This method of learning was quite manageable because I could ensure I fully understood a topic before moving on.

The teacher I had was very organized and he always marked assessments and responded to emails within 24 hours. The lessons provided were clear, concise and simple to comprehend. Additionally, the office staff were very kind and understanding. Overall, I would highly recommend OVS to any students looking to further their learning.

However, during the course, I emailed my teacher if I had any questions or any confusion about the content. My teacher was very nice; he answered my questions quickly and in detail, so I did not have any questions about doing homework or the course content.

The first time I attempted MCR3U was in person at my highschool, I failed with 43%. However, I was really determined to pass and excel in this course so by reccomendation of a guidance counselor, I looked to take the course elsewhere and try again. I found OVS on the internet while looking for a place to try again and signed up. I really like how OVS is at your own pace, it doesn't feel like a rush and i wasnt struggling to catch up to a class which i really liked. There were tons of resources on the website and lots of practice questions to go through. I ended the course with a 94% which I honestly diddn't even realize I was capable of achieving, but with the different format I really excelled! I'm planning on taking another course with OVS soon and I reccomend it to anyone who struggles hard with in-person school and deadlines!

Compared to a day school you get more freedom more time to do assigmnets or prepare for tests, infact you have whole year to do the course. The teachers are really supportive and answer emails immediately. The ovs platform is also really user friendly and its not difficult for new users to adjust.

The flexibility of e-learning allowed me to manage my time effectively and study at my own pace. The course materials were similar to my day school. They have practice tests for every unit & practice exam with full solutions, by doing those I was able to understand the problems easily and do well on original tests. My teacher Ms. Milburn was helping me throughout the course. From marking tests on time to clarifying any doubts. The lessons throughout the course were extremely helpful. I normally used to struggle with Maths, but the lessons, practice tests and exams in OVS made me understand each problem very well. I would definitely recommend OVS for any course that you want to either improve your grade or do it first time in OVS.

The teacher support was amazing! Every-time I emailed for help I got a response within a couple of hours. This helped me complete my course quickly and efficiently. I would 100% recommend!

My assignments were marked really fast and the feedback was always helpful for future assignments. I’ve completed ENG3U in summer 2023 with OVS, as well as ENG4U this summer.

I am highly satisfied with my decision to take a secondary school course with OVS this past year. I chose to do so in order to lighten my workload during my senior year and I am very happy I did so as I was able to achieve a very high mark and focus well throughout the course. If I had been more aware, I would have taken more courses with OVS during my grade 11 year. OVS is an excellent option as it allows the student to go at their own pace and the formatting online and expectations are accessible and achievable. My course teacher was exceptional as she was able to be highly responsive, return assessments quickly, provide knowledge and feedback and help me with any issues or questions throughout. The OVS staff including admin and guidance were very helpful and responsive as well. I managed to complete the course within a two month time period and there are many useful tools on the site such as the calendar feature and completion board. Overall, I give this credit option 5 out of 5 stars.

OVS is a great online learning platform, specially for those who are working or want to study at their own pace. I completed two courses with OVS which are grade 12 Biology and English. All my queries, tests and assignments were solved within a day. The process of course completion was beyond my expectations. OVS team made it super easy for me, both my teachers ( K. west & C. Bertolo) were very supportive and knowledgeable. Moreover, all the course content, tests and assessments are designed to enhance student’s learning experience and success. I used calendar feature to plan my courses which is awesome and made my journey very smooth. Furthermore, I used gamification feature by challenging other students to check my own knowledge. I highly recommend Ontario Virtual School if you are looking to study online.

Mr. Ford is the best teacher I have had so far in any of my secondary English courses. He allows a great deal of independence and flexibility in selecting learning tasks and assignments, and also provides multiple and varied opportunities to demonstrate what we have learned in each different unit of the course. Mr. Ford provides make up opportunities when necessary. He always provided precise descriptive feedback and suggestions which I could incorporate in assignments to achieve high levels. I was able to get into the post secondary program of my choice in Toronto, and I believe that excellent score in this course helped me in accomplishing this. I would strongly recommend taking ENG4U with OVS as this course is mandatory for admission to all University programs, and its marks critically count towards admissions.

My favorite book that I had to read was Macbeth, one of Shakespeare's plays, which follows King Macbeth and his rise and fall. The teacher, Mrs Sturino, was very helpful every time I needed her. She responded to emails very quickly, my assignments were graded within a day of submitting them, and she had a very good answer for every question I asked. Ontario Virtual School is a very good way to earn credits and I recommend it to anyone who needs to take an online class.

My teacher also marked my tests very quickly, with feedback to each test. I was quite impressed. They even offer courses that are not available at my day school, which I considered taking. OVS was the most popular private school at my day school, and I enrolled in it because a lot of my other classmates also did. If you have any concerns, take my word for it, it’s worth it!

I had the honor of taking the SCH4U-08 course, and I should say it was a totally great experience. I always try to find courses that intellectually challenge me while also providing an engaging and supportive environment because I am an enthusiastic learner. SCH4U-08 surpassed all of my expectations. A variety of multimedia resources, including videos, engaging assignments, and interactive simulations, were used to convey the course content. These assets improved how I might interpret the ideas and permitted me to investigate science past the bounds of a customary study hall. Additionally, the incorporation of examples and real-world applications helped me comprehend the significance of chemistry in everyday life.

Also, it only took less than three months to complete a course as there were many resources in the course, such as homework, practice tests and exams with answers.

I am a full time student at this school and I can say that the only way I could get my Canadian diploma online from outside of Canada was this school, I am still in the middle of the road but so far there have been no problems.
I will mention several points below that are noteworthy:
1-This school is not just a school with offline courses. In this school, you will always be guided by a teacher, counselor, director, etc.
2-Teachers will always answer your email within 48 hours on working days
3-This school also has a support team that will help you in this way
4-If you study in 12th grade, this school will help you in applying for university and college
5-There will be no hidden costs for you, and by purchasing a course, you can complete it until the end without incurring additional costs.
6-The quality of the lessons is such that any student with any level can understand it because the lessons have reminders from last year. And the most important thing is that if you want to enroll in this school from another country (like me), you will definitely have no problem.
7-The last point is for people who want to study in French, it is possible for you to learn all the courses in French, which is great for some Africans and Europeans whose mother tongue is French.
And in the end, I would like to thank all the staff, teachers, counselors, and the principal of the school for all their efforts and creating this high-quality school.

I am an International student looking to apply to colleges in Canada and had taken MCT4C from this virtual school to fulfill the admission requirement while being overseas. The course material is clear and concise. Homework and practice exams help a lot to reinforce the learning and when you are in doubt, you can always go back to watch the videos again. Teacher is very responsive and usually reply within a day or two while having a 12 hours time difference. Totally recommend this school if you are a looking to study in Canada and need to fill in any missing prerequisites.

I enrolled in HSB4U and I was unsure how I would do as I’ve always been involved with in person learning. With taking Ontario Virtual School, the lessons were direct and helpful, and were very high quality and included many different variations with staying involved with the course. The assessments were straight forward with mainly short answer tests and assignments. My teacher and the admin staff were always extremely helpful and extremely reliable typically responding within the day. I would 100% recommend taking Ontario Virtual School to students who value the online quality of learning.

I was enrolled in SCH3U while taking other courses. The course was flexible to my schedule so I could learn at my own pace. The course was also easy to understand, the lectures were in-depth but were not too long and throughout all of it, there were zero hidden fees. My teacher was amazing, with quick response times to any questions that I had and the marking of my tests and assignments.

I was enrolled in MCV4U while attending other classes at my regular day school. I found the flexible schedule and stress free approach to learning very helpful and motivating while completing this course. The lessons along with homework and resource material were extensive with regards to detail, examples and help available upon request. The virtual school itself was easy to navigate and understand, along with submission and test guidelines. I especially appreciated the fast marking times and email responses I received whenever a concern arose. Assessments were excellent with regards to variety of question styles and extensions of concepts learned throughout the lessons. Overall, my experience with the Ontario Virtual School surpassed my expectations and created a very encouraging work environment to motivate success.

It was super convenient to do this course, and I really enjoyed that I could decide how fast, or slow the class would move depending on my schedule outside of school. It was great that anytime I would submit, or send an email, I would get a response from the teacher in less than 24 hours.

My experience with Ontario Virtual School was amazing! I was in Canadian and International Politics (CPW4U) and had Mr. Murphy as my teacher! The teaching was phenomenal as well as the course. It was my first time taking a fully asynchronous course, but the lesson videos and teacher office hours made it an extremely successful experience! Mr. Murphy was available to answer any questions and let you know where you’re at in the course during office hours, and was so helpful. Although it was asynchronous, the structure made it much more organized making sure that success is guaranteed in the course! Being able to access my teacher for questions, clarification and feedback, so easily, helped a lot especially since we weren’t in a formal classroom! The administration of the Ontario Virtual School was also amazing, and they were always there to help answer any questions about due dates, report cards, etc. They went over and above to make sure their students have the best experience and success. Overall, my experience with Ontario Virtual School was an exceptional one and I will definitely be recommending this school to everyone! Thank you so much for everything and all that you have provided me with.

I loved doing the video assignment cause I was able to be creative and have fun with it. It’s really great for independent learners, and for those who are not I’m pretty sure there is a way to video with your teacher.

My teacher was always fast with marking and responding to emails (within a day or two), and provided me with separate articles to help me learn more.

Some issues where that instructions for assignments where a little vague. I had some trouble understanding exactly what my teacher was looking for, but I just emailed her for clarification and still got a good mark. Problem solved. The loading was also very slow but that was probably just my wifi.
No hidden fees. Very organized. Lots of time (I finished my class in a month).

Lessons were fine, you're able to draw on the slides so that was a cool feature. My teacher took at least 3 days to respond to an email. No hidden fees. Tests had a bunch of mistakes on them that make it impossible to solve, same with homework. The admins are fast with emails, and usually teachers mark tests quickly. If you're considering taking a heavy load course like calculus I wouldn't recommend, but if you want to take a course like gender studies I would assume that its fine.

I had a really great experience, it was great that I could do the work on my own pace which worked well as I was also doing in person classes, plus the fact that you could take the class anytime during the year is a bonus. The lessons were super clear and the teacher gave great feedback whenever I needed help. I really enjoyed it and recommend it for anyone looking to take an online class and to be honest I wouldn't have minded taking this OVS all year round as a full time student.

Personally I had an amazing experience with OVS, I took the business leadership course and found that it worked perfectly with my style of learning. My teacher was informative and nice, she always responded within a very short time frame including returning my marks and grades on assignments very quickly. I would highly recommend them to any students interested in wanting to pickup another couple credits !

I took grade 12 advanced functions at Ontario Virtual School. The website was easily accessible and navigating around it was simple as well. The teachers reply fairly quickly to any questions or concerns. The tests were very similar to the practice questions and the lessons were easy to understand. The good thing about this school is that it is self paced so you aren't in a rush to finish things like other schools.

My experience with Ontario Virtual School was incredible. I took the grade 12 Family Studies course. The information provided for the course was clear and concise, making me well prepared for the tests and the final. My teacher was a great communicator and was able to answer all questions in a timely manner. The help line sent in my transcript within minutes of contact. I highly recommend this school for anyone who needs to upgrade classes or just wants to stay safe at home and study.

Ontario Virtual School is a great online school to take if you're rushing for graduation or trying to find credits for your college application. I took ENG3U-04 (English Grade 11) and my experience was quite interesting. What's great about it is that you'll have a teacher that would reply to you anytime and you can also look back at your lessons whenever. Plus, you can obtain the credit anytime as long as you finish the course. However, it would be better if we could communicate with our classmates outside the formal discussion forums and also use google docs, but those minor preferences are not important if your goal is to collect as many credits as you can. Everything is worth the effort.

Would definitely recommend to a friend to try it as it has helped me learn everything I need to know for the course. 🙂

The lessons were easy to follow just like how it would be in a regular school setting. The teachers were thorough in explaining and addressing any concerns I had. The benefit of having a course online is that I was able to work at my own pace and fit the course around my daily schedule. I would highly recommend taking a course at Ontario Virtual School!

The teachers were extremely helpful and no matter what questions I asked, they replied to me as quickly as possible (I received some replies from teachers in less than 10 minutes!) They also provided me with a lot of resources and homework which prepared me for the tests and exam.

I was able to be in school full time and do online on my own time and at my own pace. I was able to pause the lesson to catch up on my notes which was very helpful. Also if there was something I didn't understand I was able to go back and rewatch it. I am now going to try take Biology online since i don't want to put too much on my plate at one time.

My teacher was incredibly helpful and always responded to my emails in an impressively short amount of time. The overall experience was amazing. I loved being able to work at my own pace and even though the lack of deadlines let me procrastinate, it also allowed me to finish half the course in less than three weeks. In the end I really enjoyed the whole experiences; tests are easy to organize and understand, no getting told off for not getting what a teacher means in the wording of a question, and most importantly no trouble with finding the information I needed for review and tests. Everything was amazing, thank you OVS for helping me graduate on time.

I was skeptical at first about how effective an online course would be without the "learning environment", but it's really as effective as you make it out to be. The course I took was SPH4C - Grade 12 Physics. All the resources are readily available, I've only had experience with one course but the professor was very prompt and courteous when responding to any questions I had. As for the whole environment issue, I realized it was fine as long as I gave myself adequate space and removed any distractions. I'm not sure if this is the case with all the programs/courses they offer, but I was given plenty of time (365 days) to finish the course I registered for, so they give you the flexibility to work at your own pace. I would say it's definitely a great substitute to physical schooling during the pandemic

She also marked my tests extremely fast, which I was super impressed by! This course is definitely worth taking, whether you just need the credit or want to prepare for university/college.

Took a couple of courses here to finish highschool and was amazed at how thorough each course was. Usually in day-school you don't have the time to cover absolutely everything, leaving you with a decent understanding of each unit. However, with OVS I was left with an impressive understanding of the concepts, far greater than I would usually accomplish at my day school.

The teachers are also very helpful, and respond to questions quickly. Overall, a great experience, would recommend to anyone needing to catch up, get ahead, or experience online school.

I was initially skeptical of online learning, especially after not being in high school for so long. However I was pleasantly surprised by how well the course delivered its content as I felt the combination of slides, recordings, quizzes, and embedded videos really kept me engaged.

The only shortcoming personally was the assigned readings that followed the lessons as I felt it was relatively easy to get distracted in a home environment. I do however believe this is less the fault of the course and more of a personal issue for myself.

The quality of the labs and tests were definitely well thought out and I had no issues with them.

I'd also like to thank my instructor for being a very helpful during this course, being there to help and answer my questions and even going as far as to let me have the opportunity to redo a lab I had botched.

My experience taking an online course from OVS was excellent! Very helpful and friendly teachers who replies quickly to your emails/questions. Would definitely recommend to those who are looking to get their high school credits!

I have had a great experience with this school and I really learned a lot from taking grade 11 bio and grade 12 bio. This course had taught me a lot and helped me improve my time management skills. The teachers are very friendly and answer any questions or concerns quickly. I would recommend everyone to enrol to this school.

I was having difficulty at school with my time management of schoolwork and my responsibilities outside of school such as sports. My mom and I decided to switch to online schooling through this program and I was able to finish courses with even higher averages because the time I could study and do tests was very flexible. You can go at your own pace and the teachers offer a lot of help, and reply to you very quickly with the best answers to any of your questions. I highly recommend doing your schooling through Ontario Virtual School, I recommended it to my friend and she is doing great in her functions course as well! I’d recommend it to any athletes or anyone that has certain responsibilities outside of school because you can accommodate it to your schedule, and you have a longer time period to finish the course!

The experience was fantastic. Physics was something I struggled with but having the liberty to work at my own pace gave me enough time to thoroughly understand the concepts. I gained a lot of confidence, and was able to enjoy the content. The teacher was also great at explaining and answering back quickly.

Ontario virtual school has provided me with the opportunity to achieve my requirements to enrol into my college. I chose the course MAP4C Mathematics. The teacher I was assigned was very patient and helped me throughout the course. Even with the difference in time zones, I found no issues as Mr. Lu (my teacher) was always ready to help. Also Ontario virtual school provides you an account with good study materials which can be viewed over and over again until the concept is understood. I was a bit afraid while joining as to how the online course would be but I can tell you today with full confidence that it was worth it as I got my certificate with 94% marks.
Once again I would like to thank my teacher Mr. Michael Lu and also would like to thank Mr. Farhez who coordinated to provide me the best experience possible. I would gladly suggest my friends, relatives and anyone I know to study here.

I have very much enjoyed my experience with grade 12 biology at Ontario Virtual School. I greatly appreciate the fact that I was able to complete the course on my own time and my instructor was incredibly helpful in answering any questions I had. I can certainly say that I effectively learnt, understood, and retained the information and it has prepared me very well for my university biology courses.
Overall, it has been a beneficial experience and is worth the money. I would highly recommend.

The BAT4M-02 (grade 12 accounting) course from Ontario Virtual School was both an enjoyable and clear course to take. My teacher responded to all of my questions and marked my assignments very quickly. As well as this the layout of the course content was clear to both follow and understand. Tools like these not only helped me achieve a great mark of 95% but also helped me learn life long skills in the progress.

I had recently finished SPH4U in a span of a month. I started in early May and was able to finish it by June. I needed the credit and I would not have been able to do it without this course. The lessons are very clear and concise and they provide you with tons of worksheets and practice questions. There is also optional assignments which helped boost my mark. The teacher got back to me within 24 hours and I had my tests marked within 48 hours. The teacher is always there to answer any questions or concerns. Overall, the experience was very smooth and I was able to finish the course with a great mark. Normally, you would have 365 days to finish it but you can do it in as little as 4 weeks like I did.

Enrolling at OVS as a full time grade 12 student was the best decision I could have made. I was skeptical before as I thought I would not be able to communicate with my teachers very well compared to face to face communication, however, I was proved wrong. All my teachers made me feel comfortable enough to ask any questions that I had and responded to me quicker than I thought they would. They were all very thorough and kind when explaining the concepts to me and were very patient with me. However, my ENG4U teacher, Ms. McDonnell, has truly been one of the greatest teachers I have met throughout my high school years. Her support has been incredible and she has helped me gain the confidence I needed in my writing more than anyone. Ms McDonnell has always instantly replied to my emails and has been patient with me even when she had to explain one concept multiple times. She is a teacher I will remember even after I have completed my post-secondary education. OVS has really helped me grow as a person and has given me the opportunity to get brilliant education. I appreciate all my teachers and all the effort they put in providing good quality education for their students.

Before I signed up for Ontario Virtual School, I wasn’t really sure about the whole idea of online school. I thought it wasn’t for me because I couldn’t juggle the day school and night school, I didn’t need any more work load. I thought it’d be a colossal waste of my time, energy and obviously money. But my friend convinced (annoyed) me to sign up and I am grateful that he did. It wasn’t easy, I am not going to lie, I mean you have to remember to listen to lecture and to write test, but with the help and support of my amazing instructor/teacher Patricia Garcia, I achieved a score of a 92% and got accepted from most of the universities I applied to. I can’t thank her and this online institution enough. I would recommend Ontario Virtual School to anyone who is thinking of taking an online school. As my experience was absolutely amazing and positive which also helped a lot with the distance learning due to COVID-19.

My name is Raina and I completed grade 12 physics at Ontario Virtual School (SPH4U). When I first started the course, I was amazed at the teaching style. Each concept was explained in detail and videos were also provided to strengthen my understanding. I also liked how I could complete the course at my own pace and did not have any pressure. My teacher was also extremely friendly and always responded quickly. All in all, I am grateful for my experience at Ontario Virtual School and I would highly recommend this for students who want to finish a course quickly and efficiently.

Ontario Virtual School was worthy of taking private online school for! I got a 93% by the end and I have learnt a LOT through the tutorials and experiences on the projects/assignments. The teachers always give a constructive criticism feedback and tell you in what ways to improve for better. If you ever have Mr. Lakhani or Mr. Murphy as your teacher, without a doubt you'll have a great learning experience and be successful by the end of the course!!! 🙂 Not to mention, I got into the university I wanted!

But, the teacher, who made the lectures of Grade 11 university biology , her voice is too suffering....I just feel so hard to tolerate, I have to stop the lecture, just read the slides, if I have questions, I have to go to YouTube for help, since she only reads the slides as well, or with very simple explanations.

I wasn't sure what to expect as it was my first time doing an online course. However, it far exceeded my expectations! F.Lakhani was an amazing teacher and responded to my concerns and questions regarding class in a timely manner. Material was very clear and concise, in which not many teachers in a traditional school would provide. Admin, Hillary Tutton I believe was also very polite and helpful in when I called to have questions answered. 10/10 would recommend! (I had done HZT4U)

Great experience with two Physics courses. Teachers were always quick to respond on my questions and grade my assignments, tests and exam.
That was important for me because I had few last minutes requests regarding application to universities deadlines.
Material was great, great animations, very few teachers in brick and mortar schools would be able to provide such a great learning experience.

Ms. McDonnell was an amazing teacher that marked assignments quickly, fairly, and with excellent feedback that encouraged me to improve my writing skills. OVS is a great way to obtain online credits, and I would recommend it to all of my fellow students.

Was very satisfied with my experience on OVS as I learned a lot more at my own pace than having the pressure of learning in school. A huge thanks to my teacher for having my tests marked on time and marking accurately.

Very nice school, much better experience than VHS. It's not a pay for marks like some comments suggest but they reward good work with good marks unlike VHS where they just cut marks for silly mistakes to keep the average down. The presentations format is also really good.

Did not know what to expect but after my son completed the course, I was sorry that I didn't learn about OVS sooner. The course is easy to navigate, turn around of assignments was very quick, our teacher was very engaged and always available to assist with any questions. Surprisingly, my son was able to focus more so than in the classroom. No classroom politics and the student can control the pace at which they move through the course. Very good experience and would definitely recommend them. Thank you, Ms. J McDonnell.

So far it’s an perfect online education because the way it provides certified teachers and the work you do isn’t that much as others do and also it gives you the access to improve your grades and upgrade also a course if you’ve failed it. I would recommend everyone to take Ontario virtual school
