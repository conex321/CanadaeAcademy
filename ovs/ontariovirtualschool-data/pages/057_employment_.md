**Part-time Teaching Opportunities**

If you are an educator at heart and would like to be part of a team of experienced Ontario certified teachers who are all committed to providing a thriving educational environment, we encourage you to apply for an online teaching position with Ontario Virtual School (OVS). Our ideal teachers are more than subject experts – they are mentors who spark enthusiasm and inspire students to dream bigger and achieve more.

With our student enrollment growing, OVS is expanding our team. We’re seeking passionate, dedicated teachers across ***all subject areas*** to join our vibrant school community.

Successful candidates will:

* follow the Ontario College of Teachers Professional Standards

Successful candidates will also have:

* A demonstrated passion and commitment toward continued professional growth and development

* Demonstrated experience using technology
* Experience and creativity in the subject matter

Experience teaching online is not essential as we provide all the technical training and IT support for a successful experience.

NOTE: Successful candidates will be added to a pool of teachers and assigned a course when enrollment reaches the minimum requirement. Student enrollment is continuous. As such, all teachers are hired on a 1-year renewable contract.

**Compensation:** Discussed during interview.

We thank all candidates in advance; however only those selected for an interview will be contacted.
