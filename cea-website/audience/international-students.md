# Earn a Globally Recognised Canadian High School Diploma — From Anywhere in the World

Canada e Academy makes it possible for international students to earn the Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD) entirely online, without leaving home. No study permit. No relocation. No high-stakes national exams.

---

## Why International Students Choose Canada e Academy

### 1. No Study Permit or Visa Required

International students do not require a Canadian study permit or visa to enrol, earn credits, and graduate with an OSSD. Study from your home country on your own schedule.

### 2. OUAC 101 Application Advantage

As a Canada e Academy OSSD graduate, you apply to Ontario universities through the domestic OUAC 101 application channel — the same application stream used by Ontario high school students. 101 applicants benefit from a significantly larger share of available university seats compared to international (105) applicants.

### 3. IELTS/TOEFL Waiver Potential

Many Canadian universities waive IELTS and TOEFL requirements for students who hold an OSSD and have completed Grade 12 University-level English (ENG4U). Policies vary by institution — confirm directly with your target university.

### 4. Credit Transfer via PLAR

Already completed high school courses in your home country? Through the Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition (PLAR) process, you may transfer up to 75% of your credits toward the OSSD — meaning you could graduate with as few as 7–8 new courses.

### 5. No High-Stakes Exams

Ontario's continuous assessment model evaluates your learning throughout the course — 70% coursework, 30% final evaluation. No single high-stakes exam determines your grade.

### 6. Global Recognition

The Ontario Secondary School Diploma is recognised by universities in 90+ countries, including Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and beyond. Earn a globally respected diploma at a fraction of the cost of traditional international schooling.
