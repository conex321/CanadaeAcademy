## Why Ontario Day School Students Choose Canada e Academy

### No Permission Needed

Since Canada e Academy is a private school, you do not need permission from your day school or school board to enrol. Register directly and start learning — it is that simple.

### Credits Transfer Seamlessly

When you complete your course, Canada e Academy sends a report card directly to your day school. Your day school adds the credit to your ongoing Ontario Student Transcript. All OSSD credits are the same regardless of where they are earned.

### Marks Sent Directly to OUAC and OCAS

Applying to university or college? Canada e Academy submits your marks directly to OUAC and OCAS on your behalf — no extra steps, no extra fees.

### Fast-Track Options

Need to complete a course quickly before a university deadline? With focused study, you can complete a course in as little as 4 weeks. Many students finish in 4–8 weeks while still attending day school.

### Flexible Scheduling

No set class times. Study before school, after school, on weekends, or during breaks. Our courses are available 24/7, so you fit learning into your schedule — not the other way around.

### Interactive Animated Lessons

Our courses are built different. Professional animation, voice narration, and interactive activities make learning engaging — so even when you are taking an extra course, it does not feel like a chore.
