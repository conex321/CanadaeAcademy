# Get a Head Start on High School

Canada e Academy's Reach Ahead programme allows elementary students to begin earning high school credits before they officially enter Grade 9. Start your journey as early as Grade 7 — earlier than most online schools in Ontario.

---

## What Is Reach Ahead?

Reach Ahead is an Ontario Ministry-recognised programme that allows elementary students (typically in Grade 7 or 8) to take high school credit courses before entering secondary school. These credits count toward the OSSD, giving students a meaningful head start.

---

## Why Start Early?

### Build Confidence

Experiencing high school-level coursework in a supportive online environment helps students build confidence before the transition to secondary school.

### Develop E-Learning Skills

Online learning requires self-discipline, time management, and digital literacy. Starting early gives students time to develop these critical skills in a low-pressure setting.

### Lighten the Future Course Load

Credits earned through Reach Ahead count toward the OSSD, meaning students may have more flexibility in their timetable during Grades 9–12.

### Explore Interests

Take a course in a subject area that interests you — whether it is art, technology, science, or another field — without waiting until Grade 9.
