## Why Parents Trust Canada e Academy

### Ministry-Inspected and Officially Credited

Canada e Academy is inspected by the Ontario Ministry of Education (BSID #665804) and authorised to grant OSSD credits — the same credits earned at any public or Catholic school in Ontario. Your child's education is real, recognised, and recorded on the official Ontario Student Transcript.

### Ontario Certified Teachers

Every course is taught by an instructor certified by the Ontario College of Teachers. Your child receives personalised feedback on assignments within 24 hours and has teacher support throughout the course.

### Interactive, Engaging Lessons

Our courses feature professionally animated, voice-narrated lessons — not just text or PDFs. Interactive activities, embedded videos, and practice quizzes keep students engaged and reinforce learning before they move forward.

### Safe Online Learning Environment

All learning takes place through our secure online platform. Courses are accessible 24/7 from any device with internet access.

## How You Can Stay Involved

### Progress Tracking

You can monitor your child's progress through report cards issued at the midpoint and upon completion of each course. If your child is a minor, parents and guardians are kept informed of academic performance.

### Student Success Monitoring

Our student success team monitors attendance and engagement patterns. If your child falls behind or appears disengaged, we reach out to the student and family to provide additional support.

### Guidance Counselling

Our guidance counsellors assist with course selection, diploma planning, and post-secondary preparation. Parents are welcome to participate in guidance discussions.
