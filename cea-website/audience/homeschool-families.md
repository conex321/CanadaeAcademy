# Structured Courses with Ontario-Credited Results — Designed for Independent Learners

Traditional education models are not suited for all learners, but that does not mean students should miss out on the benefits of an officially credited high school education. Canada e Academy helps you provide your child with quality academic courses in a format that suits their individual needs and strengths.

## Why Homeschool Families Choose Canada e Academy

### Official OSSD Credits

Ministry regulations make it difficult for homeschoolers to earn official credits toward the Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD). Enrolling with a Ministry-inspected school like Canada e Academy provides an alternative that combines the flexibility of homeschooling with officially recognised high school credits. Each course you complete earns a full OSSD credit, recorded on the Ontario Student Transcript.

### Wide Course Selection

With 75+ courses across Grades 7–12, your child can study exactly what they want and need. From university preparation mathematics and sciences to arts, business, and languages — our catalogue has it covered. Parents do not need to be experts in every subject. Our Ontario Certified Teachers handle the instruction.

### Flexible, Self-Set Schedules

Like homeschooling, Canada e Academy offers an asynchronous approach. Courses can be completed at home, any time of day or night. Students can move as quickly or as slowly as they need through concepts and skills. Complete a course in as little as 4 weeks or take up to 12 months.

### Start Early with Grades 7 and 8

Canada e Academy offers courses starting in Grade 7, helping younger learners develop critical e-learning skills while engaging with Ontario curriculum-aligned content. Use our courses to supplement an existing homeschool curriculum or to help your child prepare for high school.

### Teacher Support When You Need It

Every course is supported by an Ontario College of Teachers-certified instructor who is available to answer questions, mark assignments, and provide personalised feedback. Courses include:

- Interactive, animated lesson content with voice narration
- Practice activities with solution documents for self-checking
- Tools to track student achievement, including progress reports after each assignment
- An official report card upon completion

## Transition Between Models Gradually

Canada e Academy courses can be used alongside other content resources to expand an existing homeschool curriculum. Students taking a complete course load would be considered full-time students of Canada e Academy, a registered private school — meaning there is no need to continue submitting annual letters of intent to your local school board. Instead, the student would be demitted from their local school and their records would be transferred to and maintained by Canada e Academy.
