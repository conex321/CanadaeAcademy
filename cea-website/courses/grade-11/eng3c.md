## Course Description

Grade 11 College English allows students to develop their critical and creative skills, as well as their overall literacy and communication skills -- all of which are essential to their success in academics and in their daily lives. Throughout this course, students will study the content, form, and style of various informational and graphic texts, as well as literary texts from Canada and abroad. They will also have the opportunity to practise using language with precision and clarity through the creation of oral, written, and media texts across a variety of practical and academic forms. The programme is designed to develop a range of essential skills in four interrelated areas -- Oral Communication, Reading and Literature Studies, Writing, and Media Studies -- built on a solid foundation of knowledge of the conventions of standard English and incorporating the use of analytical, critical, and metacognitive thinking skills.
