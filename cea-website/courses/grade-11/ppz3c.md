## Course Description

This course enables students to examine the factors that influence their own health practices and behaviours as well as those factors that contribute to the development of healthy communities. It emphasises the concept of wellness, which addresses all aspects of well-being -- physical, cognitive, emotional, spiritual, and social -- and promotes healthy eating, physical activity, and building and maintaining a positive sense of self. Students will develop the skills necessary to make healthy choices and create a personal wellness plan. They will also design initiatives that encourage others to lead healthy, active lives. The course prepares students for college programmes in health sciences, fitness, wellness, and health promotion.
