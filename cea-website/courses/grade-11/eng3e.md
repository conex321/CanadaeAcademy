## Course Description

Grade 11 Workplace English allows students to enhance their overall literacy and communication skills. Throughout this course, students will study the content, form, and style of various informational and graphic texts, as well as literary texts from Canada and abroad. They will also have the opportunity to practise using language with precision and clarity through the creation of oral, written, and media texts across a variety of practical forms. The programme is designed to develop a range of essential skills in four interrelated areas -- Oral Communication, Reading and Literature Studies, Writing, and Media Studies -- built on a solid foundation of knowledge of the conventions of standard English and incorporating the use of analytical, critical, and metacognitive thinking skills.
