## Course Description

This course introduces the mathematical concept of the function by extending students' experiences with linear and quadratic relations. Students will investigate properties of discrete and continuous functions, including trigonometric and exponential functions; represent functions numerically, algebraically, and graphically; solve problems involving applications of functions; investigate inverse functions; and develop facility in determining equivalent algebraic expressions. Students will reason mathematically and communicate their thinking as they solve multi-step problems. The framework of course delivery focuses on the underlying principles of mathematics, and the organisation of the course is packaged into six distinct units corresponding with the Ontario Curriculum, Grades 11 and 12 Mathematics document.
