## Course Description

This course looks at the world from a geographic perspective. Students investigate the interactions between natural and human systems, with particular emphasis on the impacts of human activity on ecosystems and natural processes.

Through the various units, students assess resource management and sustainability practices, consider questions of individual responsibility and environmental stewardship, and explore ways of developing a more sustainable relationship with the environment.
