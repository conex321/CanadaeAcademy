## Course Description

This course focuses on enabling students to refine their use of the creative process when creating and presenting two- and three-dimensional art works using a variety of traditional and emerging media and technologies. Students use the critical analysis process to deconstruct art works and explore connections between art and society. The studio programme enables students to explore a range of materials, processes, and techniques that can be applied in their own art production. Students also make connections between various works of art in personal, contemporary, historical, and cultural contexts.
