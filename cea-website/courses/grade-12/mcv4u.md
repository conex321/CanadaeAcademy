# MCV4U: Calculus and Vectors

**Grade:** 12 | **Credit Value:** 1.0 | **Course Type:** University Preparation
**Prerequisite:** MHF4U, Grade 12 Advanced Functions (proof of completion or concurrent enrolment)

---

## Course Description

This course builds on students' previous experience with functions and their developing understanding of rates of change. Students solve problems involving geometric and algebraic representations of vectors and representations of lines and planes in three-dimensional space; broaden their understanding of rates of change to include the derivatives of polynomial, sinusoidal, exponential, rational, and radical functions; and apply these concepts and skills to the modelling of real-world relationships. This course is intended for students who choose to pursue careers in fields such as science, engineering, economics, and some areas of business, including those students who will be required to take a university-level calculus, linear algebra, or physics course.
