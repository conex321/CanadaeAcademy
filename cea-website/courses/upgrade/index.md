# Upgrade Courses

Already completed a course but want a higher mark? Canada e Academy offers upgrade versions of popular courses, allowing you to retake the course and aim for a better grade — ideal for competitive university programmes.

---

## How Upgrading Works

- You retake the full course with fresh assessments
- Your new mark replaces the old one for post-secondary application purposes
- When a course is repeated, both attempts are recorded on the Ontario Student Transcript. In Grades 11 and 12, an "R" appears next to the session with the lower grade
- Only one course attempt earns credit toward the 30 credits required for the OSSD
