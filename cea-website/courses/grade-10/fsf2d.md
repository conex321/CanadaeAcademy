## Course Description

This course provides students with the opportunity to communicate and interact in French with increasing independence, through a concentrated focus on personally relevant, familiar, and academic topics based upon real-life situations. Students exchange information, ideas, and opinions with others in guided and increasingly spontaneous spoken interactions. Students further develop their skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing through the selective use of strategies that contribute to effective communication. They also enhance their understanding and appreciation of diverse French-speaking communities and develop the skills necessary to facilitate lifelong language learning.
