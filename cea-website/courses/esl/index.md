## ESL as a Pathway

ESL courses are designed to help international students develop their English proficiency before or alongside academic OSSD courses. Each level builds on the previous one, and you can progress through as many levels as needed.

**English language learners** may count up to 3 ESL credits toward the 4 compulsory English credits required for the OSSD. The fourth credit must be a Grade 12 compulsory English course.
