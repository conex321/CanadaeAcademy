## Course Description

This course advances your skills in reading, writing, oral communication, and media literacy in preparation for high school English. You will analyse increasingly complex texts — including novels, short stories, essays, poetry, and media works — and respond critically and creatively. Writing activities challenge you to craft well-organised, persuasive, and imaginative pieces for a variety of purposes and audiences. You will strengthen your command of grammar, spelling, and punctuation, and develop your ability to communicate ideas with clarity and confidence. By the end of this course, you will have the literacy skills you need to succeed in Grade 9 English.
