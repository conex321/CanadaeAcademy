# Understanding Conditional Offers of Admission

If you have applied to Ontario universities through OUAC, you may receive a conditional offer of admission. Understanding what this means and what is expected of you is essential to ensuring your offer is not rescinded.

## What Is a Conditional Offer?

A conditional offer of admission means that a university is offering you a spot in their programme, provided you meet certain conditions. The most common condition is maintaining a minimum average in your final high school courses.

For example, an offer might state: "This offer is conditional upon you maintaining a final average of 80% or higher in your top six Grade 12 courses, with no individual mark falling below 70%."

## Why Are Offers Conditional?

Universities make offers based on the grades they have at the time -- typically your midterm or interim marks. Since these are not your final grades, universities need assurance that your academic performance will remain consistent through the end of the school year.

## What Conditions Do You Need to Meet?

The specific conditions vary by university and programme, but common requirements include:

- Maintaining a minimum overall average (often between 70% and 85%, depending on the programme)
- Maintaining a minimum mark in specific prerequisite courses
- Successfully completing all courses listed on your application
- Graduating with your OSSD

The conditions will be clearly stated in your offer letter. Read it carefully and keep it somewhere accessible.

## What Happens If Your Grades Drop?

If your final grades fall below the stated conditions, the university may:

- **Revoke your offer entirely.** This is the most serious outcome and does happen.
- **Place you on academic probation.** You may still be admitted but with conditions during your first year.
- **Defer your admission.** The university may ask you to reapply for a future term.
- **Contact you for an explanation.** Some universities will reach out before making a final decision.

## How to Protect Your Offer

- **Keep working.** Do not let your effort slide after receiving an offer. Your final marks matter.
- **Stay on top of deadlines.** Complete all assignments and assessments on time.
- **Communicate with your teachers.** If you are struggling, ask for help early rather than waiting until it is too late.
- **Monitor your grades.** Keep track of your marks throughout the semester so you know where you stand.

## What If You Are Taking Courses at Canada e Academy?

If you are completing courses at [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/) that contribute to your university application, it is important to plan your course completion around OUAC collection dates. Our administration team submits grades to OUAC according to the collection schedule.

If you have questions about when your marks will be reported, or if you need to complete a course before a specific deadline, contact us at [info@canadaeacademy.com](mailto:info@canadaeacademy.com).

## Accepting Your Offer

Once you receive an offer, you must accept it through OUAC by the deadline (typically June 1). If you receive multiple offers, compare them carefully before making your decision. Consider factors such as programme content, location, campus culture, financial aid, and co-op opportunities.
