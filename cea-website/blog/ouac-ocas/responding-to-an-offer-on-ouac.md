# Responding to an Offer on OUAC

Receiving a university offer is an exciting milestone -- congratulations! But the process does not end there. You need to respond to your offer(s) through the Ontario Universities' Application Centre (OUAC) by the required deadline. Here is what you need to know.

## Understanding Your Offers

Universities in Ontario send their admission decisions through OUAC. When you log into your OUAC account, you will see one of the following statuses for each programme you applied to:

- **Offer of Admission:** The university has accepted you into the programme
- **Alternate Offer:** The university has offered you admission to a different programme than the one you applied for
- **Refused/Declined:** The university has not offered you admission at this time
- **Pending/In Review:** A decision has not yet been made

## What to Do When You Receive an Offer

### 1. Review All Your Offers

Do not rush to accept the first offer you receive. Wait until you have heard back from all the programmes you applied to so you can make an informed decision. Most universities send offers between February and May, and you typically have until June 1 to respond.

### 2. Understand the Conditions

Most offers come with conditions -- typically, you must maintain a certain average in your final semester and successfully complete specific courses. Read the conditions carefully and make sure you can meet them.

### 3. Research Before You Decide

If you have multiple offers, take the time to research each programme and university thoroughly. Consider factors like:

- Programme curriculum and specialisations
- Campus location and culture
- Residence and campus life
- Financial aid and scholarship opportunities
- Co-op or internship programmes

### 4. Respond Through OUAC

When you are ready to make your decision, log into your OUAC account and select "Accept" for the programme you wish to attend. You can only accept one offer. For all other offers, select "Decline."

### 5. Pay Your Deposit

Most universities require a deposit to confirm your acceptance. This is typically applied toward your first-semester tuition.

## Important Deadlines

- **June 1:** Deadline to respond to offers for most Ontario universities
- Check your OUAC account and university emails regularly for programme-specific deadlines

## What If You Did Not Receive an Offer?

If you did not receive an offer from your preferred programme, do not despair. You have options:

- **Upgrade your marks:** [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/) offers [upgrade courses](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/upgrade-courses) that allow you to improve your grades and reapply
- **Consider alternative programmes:** You may have received an alternate offer that leads to your desired career path
- **Apply for the next intake:** Many programmes accept applications for winter or spring starts
