# Applying to Open University Programmes

If you are not entirely sure what you want to study at university, an open or undeclared programme may be the perfect starting point. These programmes are designed specifically for students who want to explore their options before committing to a specific major.

## What Are Open Programmes?

Open programmes (sometimes called "undeclared" or "general" programmes) allow students to enrol in a university without declaring a specific major. During your first year (and sometimes into your second year), you take courses from a variety of departments and faculties, exploring different subjects before choosing a specialisation.

## Benefits of Open Programmes

### Exploration Without Pressure

Open programmes give you the freedom to try courses in areas you are curious about without the pressure of having already committed to a major. You might discover a passion for philosophy, economics, or environmental science that you never would have considered otherwise.

### Flexibility

Because you are not locked into a specific programme, you have more flexibility in your course selection. This can be especially helpful if your interests span multiple disciplines.

### Informed Decision-Making

By the time you do declare your major, you will have a much better understanding of what each field involves, what kind of career paths it leads to, and whether it genuinely interests you.

## Considerations

### Prerequisites

Even in an open programme, it is important to take courses that will satisfy the prerequisites for the majors you are considering. For example, if there is any chance you might want to pursue a science degree, take introductory science courses in your first year.

### Timing

Most universities require students to declare a major by the end of their first or second year. Make sure you understand the timeline and requirements at your specific institution.

### Course Availability

Popular courses can fill up quickly. Register for courses as early as possible to ensure you get the ones you want.

## How to Apply

Open programmes are listed alongside other programmes on the [OUAC](https://www.ouac.on.ca/) application. When selecting your programme choices, look for options such as:

- "Bachelor of Arts (Undeclared)"
- "Bachelor of Science (General)"
- "Open Studies"

The specific name varies by university, so check each institution's website for details.

## Preparing in High School

To keep your options open for university, take a broad range of Grade 12 courses. At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/), you have access to over 170 courses across all subject areas, making it easy to build a versatile course load.

Our [guidance team](https://canadaeacademy.com/guidance) can help you plan a course schedule that keeps multiple university pathways open while meeting all OSSD graduation requirements.
