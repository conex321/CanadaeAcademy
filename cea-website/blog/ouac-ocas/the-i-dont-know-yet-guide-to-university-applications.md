# The "I Don't Know Yet" Guide to University Applications

You are in Grade 12, university applications are due soon, and you still are not sure what you want to study. Sound familiar? If so, take a deep breath -- you are far from alone, and there are strategies to help you navigate this process even without a clear plan.

## You Do Not Need to Have It All Figured Out

The pressure to choose a career path at 17 or 18 is immense, but the reality is that most adults will change careers multiple times throughout their lives. Your university programme does not have to define the rest of your future. What matters right now is making a thoughtful choice that keeps your options open.

## Strategies for the Undecided Student

### Apply Broadly

If you are unsure about your major, apply to a variety of programmes that interest you. Many universities allow you to apply to multiple programmes, giving you options when it comes time to accept.

### Consider General Programmes

Many universities offer general first-year programmes in Arts, Science, or Social Sciences that allow you to explore different subjects before committing to a major. These programmes are specifically designed for students who want to keep their options open.

### Keep Your Prerequisites Flexible

If you are undecided, take a broad range of Grade 12 courses that satisfy prerequisites for multiple programmes. Key courses to consider include:

- [ENG4U English](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng4u) -- required by virtually every programme
- [MHF4U Advanced Functions](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mhf4u) -- required by science, business, and engineering programmes
- [MCV4U Calculus and Vectors](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mcv4u) -- required by STEM programmes
- [SBI4U Biology](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sbi4u) and [SCH4U Chemistry](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sch4u) -- required by health and life sciences programmes

### Talk to People

Reach out to people working in fields that interest you. Ask them about their educational journey and career path. You might be surprised by how winding their path was -- and how that is perfectly normal.

### Use University Resources

Most universities have excellent resources for undecided students, including academic advising, career counselling, and mentorship programmes. Take advantage of these from day one.

## The OUAC Process

Regardless of your certainty about your path, you still need to complete the OUAC application by the deadline. Here are the key steps:

1. Create your [OUAC account](https://www.ouac.on.ca/) early
2. Select up to three programme choices (OUAC 101) or up to three universities with unlimited programmes (OUAC 105)
3. Pay the application fee
4. Ensure your transcripts are submitted -- if you are studying at [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/), we submit transcripts on your behalf

## It Will Work Out

Remember: choosing a university programme is important, but it is not irreversible. Many students transfer between programmes, add minors, or change paths entirely. The most important thing is to start somewhere and stay open to where the journey takes you.
