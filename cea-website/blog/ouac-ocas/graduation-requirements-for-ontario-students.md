# Graduation Requirements for Ontario Students

Earning your Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD) is an important milestone that opens doors to post-secondary education and career opportunities. Understanding the requirements is the first step toward achieving this goal. Here is a clear breakdown of what you need.

## The Three OSSD Requirements

To earn your OSSD, you must complete all three of the following requirements:

### 1. Earn 30 Credits

You need a total of 30 credits, divided into 18 compulsory credits and 12 optional (elective) credits.

**Compulsory Credits (18):**
- 4 credits in English (one per grade)
- 3 credits in Mathematics (at least one in Grade 11 or 12)
- 2 credits in Science
- 1 credit in Canadian History
- 1 credit in Canadian Geography
- 1 credit in the Arts
- 1 credit in Health and Physical Education
- 1 credit in French as a Second Language
- 0.5 credit in Career Studies
- 0.5 credit in Civics
- Plus 3 additional compulsory credits from designated groups

**Elective Credits (12):**
You choose these based on your interests, strengths, and post-secondary plans. This is where you can tailor your education to align with your goals.

### 2. Complete 40 Hours of Community Involvement

You must complete 40 hours of unpaid community involvement outside of instructional hours. These hours can be accumulated at any time during your high school years.

### 3. Pass the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Requirement

Students must demonstrate literacy proficiency, typically through the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test (OSSLT). If a student does not pass the OSSLT, they can fulfil this requirement by successfully completing the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Course (OLC4O).

Ontario has introduced a requirement for students to earn a minimum of two online learning credits as part of their 30 credits toward the OSSD. At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/), all of our courses are delivered online, so any course completed with us satisfies this requirement.
