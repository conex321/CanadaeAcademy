# Applying to University as an OUAC 105 Student

Applying to university can be confusing and stressful. When you are in Grade 12 at a full-time Ontario high school, the process is made a little easier, as guidance counsellors and OUAC make it fairly straightforward to apply as a 101 student.

The challenge comes when you are no longer attending a full-time Ontario high school. You can still apply to universities through OUAC, but the system works quite differently and there is not always a lot of support available. At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com), we do our best to support and guide every student, both through their courses and the application process. In this article, we will discuss what it means to be an OUAC 105 student and how the application process works.

## What Is a 105 Student?

The first thing you need to know is what it means to be a 105 student. There are certain criteria that must be met for you to be considered a 105 applicant. If you meet any of the following requirements, you could qualify as a 105.

**1. You currently reside in Canada,** you are not currently attending an Ontario high school full-time programme, and you are either a Canadian citizen, permanent resident, or studying in Canada on a study permit or visa.

**2. You currently live outside Canada,** you are not attending an Ontario high school full-time programme, and you are either a Canadian citizen or permanent resident.

**3. You currently reside outside Canada,** you are not attending an Ontario high school full-time programme, and you are not a Canadian citizen or permanent resident.

It is also worth noting that even if you are attending a full-time high school in Ontario but are 21 or older, you would still be considered a 105 applicant rather than a 101 applicant.

If you meet any of the above criteria, you could be considered a 105 student. If you are still unsure, OUAC has a [questionnaire](https://www.ouac.on.ca/application-selection-tool/) you can complete to help determine your status.

## How to Start Your 105 Application

Now that you have determined that you are a 105 student, you need to begin the application process. Start by creating an OUAC account. Unlike 101 students, you do not need a PIN letter. You can simply go to the [OUAC 105](https://www.ouac.on.ca/ouac-105/) page and create an account.

Once you have an account, you can begin setting up your application. You will need to enter your personal information, including citizenship and language details. You will also need to provide contact information, especially your email, as this is where you will receive notifications about updates and university acceptances. Before you can continue with the process, you will need to verify your email.

When you have the basics completed, it is time to enter your academic background information. This is where you will include all details regarding your previous school history. You will need to list all high school and post-secondary institutions where you have taken one or more courses. Make sure everything is complete and accurate before moving on to the next step.

After all your information is entered, you will reach the programme choice section. You should ensure that you have done your research on university programmes and admissions criteria. OUAC offers detailed information on programmes, including prerequisites, important deadlines, and additional admission requirements such as supplementary forms.

For each school you wish to apply to, you will need to complete the programme detail section. You will need to provide details such as your expected date of enrolment, whether you intend to be full-time or part-time, and your major interest. Some programmes may require additional information.

When you have completed this step, all your programme choices will appear in a list. You can add or remove choices from the list. You must also rank your choices based on your preferences, from the school you most want to attend to the one that serves more as a safety or backup programme. While you can apply to as many universities as you wish, there may be additional fees, and you are limited to a maximum of three programmes per any one university.

## Adding and Requesting Transcripts and Documents

You have started your application and chosen your schools; now you need to add your records. Some high schools in Ontario allow students to request transcripts through OUAC. However, many require that you contact them directly.

At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/contact), students will need to reach out to our office to request that we send transcripts to their universities. In order to send these records, we will need your student number associated with the school along with a contact email for the university. Along with final grades, if you are currently taking a course with us, we can update universities with proof of enrolment and midterm grades.

Beyond this, some schools may require that you upload transcripts and documents directly to your portal pages. However, this varies from school to school, and you will need to contact your university for more information regarding their document portals.

If you have any other questions about setting up your 105 account or sending documents, please feel free to [reach out to us](https://canadaeacademy.com/contact).
