# Preparing for University Applications with Online Credits

University applications can be a stressful process, especially if you are missing prerequisites, need to improve your grades, or want to strengthen your academic profile. Online courses can be a powerful tool for preparing a competitive application. Here is how credits from [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/) can help.

## Fulfilling Prerequisites

Many university programmes require specific high school courses for admission. If you are missing a prerequisite -- perhaps because it was not offered at your day school, or you did not realise you would need it -- you can take it online through Canada e Academy. Popular prerequisite courses include:

- [MHF4U Advanced Functions](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mhf4u)
- [MCV4U Calculus and Vectors](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mcv4u)
- [SCH4U Chemistry](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sch4u)
- [SBI4U Biology](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sbi4u)
- [SPH4U Physics](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sph4u)
- [ENG4U English](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng4u)

## Upgrading Marks

If your current marks are not competitive enough for your desired programme, our [upgrade courses](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/upgrade-courses) allow you to retake a course and aim for a higher grade. Since universities typically consider your highest mark in a course, upgrading can significantly improve your application.

## Adding Breadth to Your Application

Universities want to see that you have challenged yourself academically. Taking additional courses beyond the minimum requirements demonstrates ambition and intellectual curiosity. Elective courses in the humanities, sciences, or business can add depth to your academic profile.

## Managing the Timeline

When taking courses for university applications, timing is important. Work with our [guidance team](https://canadaeacademy.com/guidance) to plan your course completion around key OUAC collection dates, ensuring that your grades are included when universities review your application.

## Are Online Credits Treated Differently?

No. Credits earned at Canada e Academy are official Ontario credits, fully recognised by OUAC and all Ontario universities and colleges. Your transcript does not differentiate between credits earned online and those earned at a traditional school.

## Getting Started

If you are preparing for university applications and want to strengthen your academic profile, contact us at [info@canadaeacademy.com](mailto:info@canadaeacademy.com) or visit our [guidance page](https://canadaeacademy.com/guidance) to book a consultation. We can help you develop a plan that maximises your chances of admission to your desired programme.
