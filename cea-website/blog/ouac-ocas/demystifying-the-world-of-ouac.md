# Demystifying the World of OUAC

It is that time of year again — the process of applying to university has begun mystifying high school seniors and mature students across Ontario (and beyond). If you, too, have been frantically searching your way to some vague understanding of how OUAC works and what you need to do in order to gain acceptance into your chosen post-secondary institution, take a breath and relax. Canada e Academy has you covered, with answers to all your burning OUAC questions in one convenient place.

## What Is OUAC and Why Does It Exist?

OUAC, also known as the **Ontario University Application Centre**, is a hub where Ontario universities go to view student marks from across the province. Based on the marks posted on OUAC, universities make decisions about which students qualify for admission offers.

## Will Universities See All My Marks on OUAC?

OUAC hosts all Grade 11 and 12 marks for universities to view. However, universities are really only interested in a student's "top six." This refers to your top six marks earned in courses whose codes end in -U or -M (e.g. ENG4U or BBB4M). Depending on the programme you are applying to, there may be specific courses that a university will look for regardless of achievement (i.e. if you are applying to a Science or Math-based programme, they will want to see your marks for Grade 12 science and math).

## Am I a 101 or a 105 Applicant?

In OUAC's eyes, there are only two types of university applicants:

- **101 Applicants:** Those applying to university directly from an Ontario high school.
- **105 Applicants:** Those applying from basically any other situation, e.g.:
  - A student who attended high school outside of Ontario (including internationally)
  - A student who has been out of school for more than seven consecutive months
  - A mature student who has attended a post-secondary institution previously

**If you are a 101 applicant:** Your full-time day school will issue all the information necessary to create your OUAC account.

**If you are a 101 applicant taking courses with Canada e Academy:** We can send your marks directly to OUAC during one of their collection periods. For us to do that, we need to have your OUAC reference number (year of application plus six digits) on file. This will be automatically assigned to you once your OUAC account has been created.

**If you are a 105 applicant:** You will still need to create a 105 account with OUAC. However, OUAC will not be responsible for distributing your marks to universities. Instead, you will have to send all documents directly to your universities.

**If you are a 105 applicant taking courses with Canada e Academy:** We will not be able to submit your marks to OUAC, as they will not be accepted. With that said, our guidance team is more than happy to assist you in sending your report cards and transcripts where they need to go, upon request.

## How Do I Find My OUAC Reference Number?

Once you have created your OUAC account using the PIN provided to you by your home school, you can find your OUAC Reference Number (year plus six digits) in the top left-hand side of your account homepage.

## When Does OUAC Collect Marks?

OUAC runs a series of collection dates and deadlines. All 101 students must follow these deadlines whether they are in standard day school, online, night, or summer school.

**OUAC Collection Periods:**
- **October/November** — Grade 11 and 12 finals and current course enrolments
- **February** — Semester 1 finals and non-semester current grades
- **April** — Semester 2 midterms
- **July** — Semester 2 finals
- **August** — Any remaining grades and/or summer school courses

## What Role Does Canada e Academy Play?

Given the nature of our school, we offer flexible start and completion deadlines. However, we do still have to follow OUAC's collection dates for mark submissions.

**For full-time Canada e Academy students:** We will create your OUAC PIN and will be responsible for updating and managing your courses on OUAC. We will also finalise your records and account once you complete your OSSD requirements.

**For part-time Canada e Academy students:** When requesting your midterm or final report cards, be sure to include your OUAC reference number, beginning with your application year plus six randomised numbers. Please note that providing an incorrect OUAC reference number means your mark will not be updated successfully. When submitting your OUAC number, please double-check that you are submitting the correct year's applicant number and that the six unique digits are correct.

## How Long Does It Take for My Marks to Appear on OUAC?

If you are completing a course within an accepted finals collection period, it will take Canada e Academy up to three business days for your report card to be processed and sent to OUAC. It can then take OUAC up to three additional business days to add your marks to your account. Please be sure to submit your requests at least one full week in advance of your deadlines to avoid any issues.

**Important:** April, May, and June are amongst the busiest times for graduating students. Leading into these months, teachers will set specific deadlines to make sure students are completing their courses in time for graduation and/or OUAC updates. Students must remain aware of these deadlines and follow them closely, as failure to do so can result in missed course completion and declined acceptance offers.
