# OCAS Updates: Applying to Ontario Colleges

If you are considering attending an Ontario college, your application will go through the Ontario College Application Service (OCAS) at [ontariocolleges.ca](https://www.ontariocolleges.ca/). Here is what you need to know about the process.

## What Is OCAS?

OCAS is the centralised application system for all publicly funded colleges in Ontario. Just as OUAC handles university applications, OCAS handles college applications. Through OCAS, you can apply to up to five programme choices at any of Ontario's 24 publicly funded colleges.

## Key Dates

- **October:** Applications typically open for the following September intake
- **February 1:** Equal consideration deadline -- all applications received by this date are given equal consideration
- **After February 1:** Applications are still accepted on a first-come, first-served basis, but popular programmes may already be full
- **May 1:** Confirmation deadline -- you must confirm your acceptance by this date

## How to Apply

### 1. Research Programmes

Before applying, research the programmes that interest you. Consider factors like curriculum, co-op opportunities, location, and career outcomes. The OCAS website allows you to search and compare programmes across all 24 colleges.

### 2. Check Requirements

Each programme has specific admission requirements. Common requirements include:

- Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD) or equivalent
- Specific course prerequisites (which vary by programme)
- Minimum grade averages

### 3. Create an Account and Apply

Visit [ontariocolleges.ca](https://www.ontariocolleges.ca/) to create an account and submit your application. You can apply to up to five programmes for a single application fee.

### 4. Submit Transcripts

Your high school transcripts will need to be sent to OCAS. If you are a student at [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/), our administration team will send your transcripts directly to OCAS on your behalf.

### 5. Wait for Offers

Colleges will review your application and send offers through your OCAS account. Offers are typically sent between November and May.

## Tips for a Strong Application

- **Meet prerequisites:** Ensure you have completed or are enrolled in all required courses. If you are missing a prerequisite, you can take it online through [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses)
- **Apply early:** Some programmes fill up quickly, so submitting your application before the equal consideration deadline is important
- **Keep your grades up:** Offers are conditional on maintaining your academic performance
- **Explore all options:** Ontario colleges offer a wide range of programmes, from diplomas to advanced diplomas to degree programmes
