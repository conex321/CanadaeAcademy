# How to Choose the Right University Programme

Choosing a university programme is one of the biggest decisions you will make as a high school student. With hundreds of programmes available at Ontario universities, it can feel overwhelming. Here is a practical framework to help you narrow down your options and make a confident choice.

## Start with Your Interests

The best programme is one that genuinely interests you. Students who are engaged with their studies are more likely to succeed, participate in their academic community, and pursue meaningful careers after graduation.

Ask yourself:

- What subjects do I enjoy most in high school?
- What topics do I find myself reading about or exploring in my free time?
- What kind of work do I imagine myself doing after university?

## Consider Your Strengths

Your academic strengths can help guide your decision. If you consistently excel in math and science, programmes in engineering, health sciences, or computer science might be a natural fit. If you thrive in English, history, and the social sciences, consider arts, humanities, or social science programmes.

That said, do not limit yourself to what comes easily. University is also an opportunity to challenge yourself and grow.

## Research Career Outcomes

While it is not necessary to have your entire career mapped out at 17 or 18, it is helpful to understand the general career paths associated with different programmes. Look into:

- What kinds of jobs do graduates of this programme typically pursue?
- Are there co-op or internship opportunities built into the programme?
- What is the employment rate for graduates?
- Does the programme lead to professional designations or certifications?

## Look at Prerequisites

Different programmes have different prerequisite courses. Make sure you are taking the right courses in high school to keep your options open. If you are missing a prerequisite, you can take it through [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/) at any time.

Common prerequisites for popular programmes include:

- **Engineering:** MHF4U, MCV4U, SPH4U, SCH4U, ENG4U
- **Business:** MHF4U (sometimes MCV4U), ENG4U
- **Health Sciences:** SBI4U, SCH4U, MHF4U, ENG4U
- **Computer Science:** MHF4U, MCV4U, ENG4U
- **Arts and Social Sciences:** ENG4U, plus electives in relevant areas

## Visit Campuses and Attend Open Houses

If possible, visit the campuses of the universities you are considering. Many universities host open houses and information sessions where you can tour the facilities, meet professors, and talk to current students. These visits can give you a feel for the campus culture and help you decide where you would be most comfortable.

## Talk to People

Speak with people who can offer insights:

- Your guidance counsellor
- Teachers in subjects related to your areas of interest
- University admissions staff
- Current university students or recent graduates

Hearing firsthand experiences can help you make a more informed decision.

## Keep an Open Mind

Many students change their programme or major during their first or second year of university. Choosing a programme is an important decision, but it is not necessarily a permanent one. Focus on choosing something that interests you now, and trust that you will have opportunities to adjust your path as you learn more about yourself and your goals.
