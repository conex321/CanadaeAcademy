# OUAC Midterm Collections: What You Need to Know

If you have applied to Ontario universities through OUAC, you may be wondering about midterm mark collections and how they affect your application. Here is what you need to know.

## What Are Midterm Collections?

Throughout the school year, OUAC collects updated academic information from Ontario secondary schools and sends it to the universities you applied to. These collections include your latest grades, course enrolments, and any changes to your academic record.

Universities use this information to make admission decisions. As your grades are updated, universities review them and may send out offers (or, in rare cases, revise existing offers).

## When Do Collections Happen?

OUAC conducts several mark collections throughout the academic year, typically in:

- **November:** Initial grades from the current school year
- **February:** Midterm marks for Semester 1 courses and interim marks for full-year courses
- **April:** Final marks for Semester 1 courses and interim marks for Semester 2 courses
- **July:** Final marks for all courses

The exact dates vary each year. Check the [OUAC website](https://www.ouac.on.ca/) for the current schedule.

## Why Do Midterm Marks Matter?

Midterm marks are often the first set of grades universities see from your current school year. For many programmes, these marks play a significant role in admission decisions. Strong midterm marks can lead to early offers of admission, while weaker marks may result in universities waiting for final grades before making a decision.

## What This Means for Canada e Academy Students

If you are taking courses at [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/), it is important to be aware of the OUAC collection schedule and plan your coursework accordingly.

## Tips for Students

- **Stay on track with your coursework:** Do not let your grades slip after submitting your application. Universities continue to monitor your academic performance.
- **Complete courses strategically:** If you are taking a course to improve your application, aim to complete it before a key OUAC collection date.
- **Communicate with your school:** If you have concerns about your marks or the timing of submissions, speak with your teachers or guidance counsellor early.
