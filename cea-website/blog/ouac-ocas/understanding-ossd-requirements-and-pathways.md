# Understanding OSSD Requirements and Pathways

For those unfamiliar with the [Ontario Secondary School Diploma](https://canadaeacademy.com/ossd-requirements), it can be hard to figure out which courses you need to take, how many, and to understand what pathways will lead you to the future that you want. At Canada e Academy, we want to make sure all our students understand their options and make the choices that are right for their educational goals.

## Graduation Requirements

All students pursuing an OSSD must complete the following requirements to graduate:

- Earn **30 credits**
- Complete **40 hours of community service**
- Complete the **Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test (OSSLT)**

Once you have completed all necessary requirements, you will earn your OSSD. Now, understanding what you need to do and knowing how to do it are two very different things. In this article, we will break down the requirements so you will have a clear picture of how to graduate.

## Taking Courses at Canada e Academy

Students earn 30 credits throughout their four years of high school. There is a full list of required credits that students must take — 18 in all — while the remaining 12 credits are electives based on student interest and post-secondary plans. How students structure their course requirements varies from student to student. However, here is a typical breakdown:

### Grade 9 (8 credits)

- English ([ENG1D](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng1d))
- Math ([MTH1W](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mth1w))
- Science ([SNC1W](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/snc1w))
- Canadian Geography ([CGC1D](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/cgc1d))
- Art ([AVI1O](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/avi1o))
- French ([FSF1D](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/fsf1d))
- Health and Physical Education ([PPL1O](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/ppl1o))
- Group 1 or 2 credit

### Grade 10 (8 credits)

- English ([ENG2D](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng2d))
- Math ([MPM2D](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mpm2d))
- Science ([SNC2D](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/snc2d))
- Canadian History ([CHC2D](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/chc2d))
- Civics/Careers ([CHV2O](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/chv2o) and [GLC2O](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/glc2o))
- Group 1 or 2 credit
- Elective

### Grade 11 (7-8 credits)

- English ([ENG3U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng3u) or [ENG3C](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng3c))
- Math ([MCR3U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mcr3u), [MCF3M](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mcf3m), or [MBF3C](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mbf3c))
- Group 3 credit
- 4-5 electives

### Grade 12 (6-7 credits)

- English ([ENG4U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng4u) or [ENG4C](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng4c))
- 5-6 electives

This is just a general idea. Students can adjust their course load and even move around course requirements between grades. With Canada e Academy, you are able to structure your education in a way that is flexible, and we are always happy to help make sure you are taking the courses you need.

## Pathway Planning

Another thing many parents and students struggle with is understanding how course levels and pathways work. For Ontario students, in Grades 9 and 10 you can take Applied, Academic, or Open level courses. In Grades 11 and 12, you can take University, Mixed, College, or Open level courses. Learning the difference and knowing how these courses work together will help you carve a path through high school and lead you to your post-secondary journey.

It all starts with where you think you might like to go for your higher education. Knowing whether you want to go to college or university is important when it comes to planning your high school courses.

**Planning for university:** While different programmes have specific course requirements, all Canadian universities will look at your top six Grade 12 U/M courses. To take University/Mixed level courses in Grades 11 and 12, you will need to take Academic level courses in Grades 9 and 10, as these courses serve as prerequisites.

**Planning for college:** You will want to take either College or Mixed level courses in Grade 12, which means taking the Applied or Academic level courses in Grades 9 and 10.

It is okay if you are not sure where you want to go after high school. If you choose one pathway and find out that it is not going to work for you, it is possible to adjust along the way. But having a plan can help make it easier to organise your courses and pick the stream that is right for you.

## Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test

Beyond taking necessary credits, students will need to successfully complete the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test (OSSLT). This is a written test offered once or twice a year that most students write in Grade 10.

If you are unsuccessful in passing the test, do not worry — there is another option. At Canada e Academy, we offer the Ontario Literacy Course ([OLC4O](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/olc4o)). Students are able to take this course if they have not passed the literacy test and need another option to meet the requirement.

Now you should have a clearer understanding of the requirements to earn the OSSD. At Canada e Academy, we strive to ensure all of our students — both local and international — understand exactly what they need to graduate, and we do everything we can to ensure their success.
