# Understanding the OUAC Undergraduate Application

The Ontario Universities' Application Centre (OUAC) is the gateway to applying to Ontario's universities. If you are planning to attend university in Ontario, understanding how the OUAC system works is essential. Here is a comprehensive guide to help you through the process.

## OUAC 101 vs OUAC 105

There are two main application streams:

### OUAC 101

This stream is for current Ontario high school students who are taking courses at an Ontario secondary school. If you are a full-time student at [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/) or another Ontario high school, you will use this stream.

### OUAC 105

This stream is for all other applicants, including:
- Students who have previously attended an Ontario secondary school but are not currently enrolled
- Students from other Canadian provinces
- International students
- Mature students
- Students who have attended college or university

## How to Apply

### Step 1: Create Your Account

Visit [ouac.on.ca](https://www.ouac.on.ca/) and create an account. For 101 applicants, your school will provide you with an access code.

### Step 2: Select Your Programmes

You can apply to up to three programme choices (101) or three universities with unlimited programmes per university (105). Research each programme carefully before making your selections.

### Step 3: Complete Your Application

Fill in all required information, including personal details, academic history, and any supplementary materials required by specific programmes (such as essays, portfolios, or auditions).

### Step 4: Pay the Application Fee

Submit your application fee to complete the process. Fees vary depending on the number of programmes you apply to.

### Step 5: Submit Transcripts

If you are a Canada e Academy student, our administration team will submit your transcripts directly to OUAC. You do not need to arrange this yourself.

## Key Dates

While specific dates vary each year, here is a general timeline:

- **October/November:** Applications open
- **January:** Application deadline for 101 applicants
- **February-May:** Universities send out offers of admission
- **June 1:** Deadline to accept offers

Check the [OUAC website](https://www.ouac.on.ca/) for the most current dates.

## Tips for a Strong Application

- **Apply early:** Do not wait until the last minute. Early applications demonstrate organisation and enthusiasm.
- **Research thoroughly:** Understand the requirements and expectations of each programme you apply to.
- **Put effort into supplementary applications:** Many competitive programmes require additional essays, interviews, or portfolios. Give these your best effort.
- **Keep your grades up:** Offers are conditional on maintaining your academic performance through your final semester.
