# Understanding De-Streaming in Ontario

Previously, Ontario students were required to pick an academic stream from the moment they started high school. They had to choose between taking Academic courses, which would allow them to take university-level credits later on, or Applied courses, which would direct them towards college-level courses for their Grade 11 and 12 years. However, the practice of making students choose an academic pathway as early as Grade 9 has been heavily criticised.

Research has shown that this system disproportionately affected certain groups of students. Studies found that students taking Applied courses in Grade 9 were much less likely to attend university, and that students from lower-income backgrounds were more likely to enrol in Applied courses.

In an effort to make the transition into Grade 9 easier and more equitable for all students, the Ontario Ministry of Education decided to de-stream Grade 9 courses. By previously requiring students to choose an academic pathway from the start, the old system limited their options moving forward. Most students going into Grade 9 have not even begun to think about post-secondary, and they should not have to. By de-streaming Grade 9 courses, students are given more time to learn without having to make a life-shaping decision right out of the gate.

## How Do De-Streamed Pathways Work?

Now that Grade 9 courses no longer force students to choose a pathway, their options remain open for Grade 10 and beyond. From de-streamed Grade 9 courses, students are able to move into either the Academic or Applied courses for Grade 10. This gives students an entire year of high school before they have to truly start thinking about their academic future.

For example, in mathematics, students take the de-streamed [Grade 9 Math (MTH1W)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mth1w) course. From there, they can choose either the Academic or Applied pathway for Grade 10, and continue building towards their preferred post-secondary destination in Grades 11 and 12.

## Canada e Academy and De-Streaming

Since the Ministry of Education announced the new practice of de-streamed courses, Canada e Academy has worked diligently to ensure that our courses meet the updated curriculum requirements. We offer de-streamed courses for both Math ([MTH1W](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mth1w)) and Science ([SNC1W](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/snc1w)).

### De-Streamed Grade 9 Science (SNC1W)

This course enables students to develop their understanding in biology, chemistry, physics, and earth and space science. Students will learn STEM skills that they will use in scientific research, experimentation, and engineering.

### De-Streamed Grade 9 Math (MTH1W)

This course allows students to consolidate and continue to develop their mathematics skills. They will learn about number sense and operations, algebra, measurement, geometry, data, probability, and financial literacy.

For English, French, and Geography, these courses continue to be offered at the Academic level for all students, while French also has an open-level option for students who have never studied the language before.

Here at [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com), we are dedicated to making education accessible for all students, and our de-streamed Grade 9 courses reflect this commitment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What does de-streaming mean?**
De-streaming means that Grade 9 courses in Ontario no longer separate students into Academic and Applied streams. All students take the same course, keeping their options open for Grade 10 and beyond.

**Does de-streaming affect Grade 10 courses?**
No. Starting in Grade 10, students can still choose between Academic and Applied pathways based on their goals and interests.

**Does Canada e Academy offer de-streamed courses?**
Yes. We currently offer de-streamed Grade 9 Math (MTH1W) and Grade 9 Science (SNC1W), both of which align with the Ontario curriculum.
