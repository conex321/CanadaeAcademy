# University Scholarship Applications: Tips for Success

Post-secondary education is a significant investment, but scholarships and bursaries can help make it more affordable. Whether you are entering your first year or are already enrolled, there are thousands of scholarship opportunities available to Canadian students. Here is how to find them and put your best foot forward.

## Types of Scholarships

**Entrance Scholarships:** Many universities automatically consider incoming students for entrance scholarships based on their high school grades. These often require no separate application -- your grades do the talking.

**Application-Based Scholarships:** These require students to submit an application, which may include essays, letters of recommendation, or a portfolio. While they require more effort, the competition is often lower because fewer students apply.

**Need-Based Bursaries:** Unlike scholarships, bursaries are awarded based on financial need rather than academic merit. If your family has financial constraints, be sure to explore bursary options.

**External Scholarships:** Many organisations outside of universities offer scholarships to Canadian students. These include community organisations, corporations, professional associations, and charitable foundations.

## Where to Find Scholarships

- **University financial aid websites:** Each university lists its available scholarships and bursaries
- **[Scholarships Canada](https://www.scholarshipscanada.com/):** A comprehensive database of scholarships searchable by criteria
- **[Universities Canada](https://www.univcan.ca/programs-and-scholarships/):** Lists scholarship programmes across Canadian universities
- **Your high school guidance department:** At Canada e Academy, our [guidance team](https://canadaeacademy.com/guidance) can help point you in the right direction

## Tips for Strong Applications

### 1. Start Early

Scholarship deadlines vary widely and many fall well before your post-secondary programme begins. Create a calendar of deadlines and start working on applications early.

### 2. Tailor Each Application

Avoid using the same generic essay for every scholarship. Read the criteria carefully and tailor your response to match what the scholarship committee is looking for.

### 3. Tell Your Story

Scholarship committees want to know who you are beyond your grades. Share your experiences, challenges, goals, and passions. Be authentic and specific.

### 4. Proofread Everything

Errors in your application can create a poor impression. Proofread your essays multiple times and ask someone you trust to review them as well.

### 5. Apply Broadly

Do not limit yourself to one or two scholarships. Apply to as many as you are eligible for -- every dollar counts.

### 6. Keep Records

Track which scholarships you have applied for, their deadlines, and any follow-up required. This will help you stay organised and ensure you do not miss any opportunities.

## The Value of Strong Grades

Many scholarships, particularly entrance scholarships, are directly tied to your academic performance. If your current grades are not where you want them to be, consider taking [upgrade courses at Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/upgrade-courses) to improve your marks and increase your scholarship eligibility.
