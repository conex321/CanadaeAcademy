# How Can You Bulk Up Your Resume?

Your resume is looking a little sparse, and you want to add more to it so that you look like an ideal candidate to employers. The problem is that you have no idea how! Here are four things that you can do to bulk up your resume, even when you have a busy schedule.

## 1. Schooling

Are you missing out on job opportunities because you are missing a high school diploma? Or are you missing post-secondary education because you did not take the right prerequisites in high school? Then this is your perfect opportunity to sign up for [online school](https://canadaeacademy.com/) so that you can fill out these education gaps as soon as possible. You can get a high school diploma or get prerequisites for the college or university programmes you want to apply for.

Online school allows mature students to complete their schooling without interrupting their busy schedules. You have the flexibility to tackle your coursework at times that are convenient for you -- whether that is in the morning, after work, or on the weekends. You will have up to 12 months to finish a course.

How will this bulk up your resume? You can add your diploma or relevant courses to the Education section of your resume. You can also list important skills you achieved through your coursework in the Relevant Skills section.

## 2. Language

Being bilingual or multilingual is an impressive asset to lots of employers. If you speak more than one language, you should say so in your resume -- even if you are not fluent. You can say that you are "familiar" or "comfortable" with a language.

What if you only speak one language? You can learn another one. Programmes like Duolingo and Memrise can help you learn a new language for free in a short amount of time.

Be strategic with your language choice. According to [Statistics Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/subjects-start/languages), some of the most popular languages outside of English and French are Mandarin, Cantonese, Punjabi, Tagalog, Spanish, Arabic, Italian, and German.

## 3. Technical Skills

Most modern office jobs are looking for candidates with strong technical skills. There are plenty of free tutorials online that can help you get acquainted with programmes like MS Office, QuickBooks, and Photoshop. Look at job postings in your field to see which programmes they mention in their qualifications.

## 4. Volunteer Work

Do not forget to add your volunteer experiences to your resume. It shows that you are dedicated, responsible, and driven to help others outside of work. If you have recently attended high school, you should write about the volunteering you completed for your mandatory 40 hours of community service. If you have not done much volunteer work since then, you can easily find opportunities at local libraries, community centres, schools, and charities.

All of these will help you fill up those gaps in your resume. You will look like the ideal candidate.
