# Pathways in Natural Sciences: A Closer Look

Whether you are planning for the coming school year using traditional learning or a hybridised curriculum that utilises the flexibility and approachability of e-learning, Canada e Academy is here to help keep you on track. In this article, we are shining a spotlight on the benefits of online study, particularly as they apply to university study in the Natural Sciences.

## Canada's Impressive Scientific History

From Frederick Banting and J.J.R. Macleod's discovery of insulin at the University of Toronto in the 1920s to the groundbreaking research of Harry Whittington on the mysterious lifeforms of the Burgess Shale, Canada has always been a country at the forefront of scientific development. Canadian post-secondary institutions offer world-class programmes in the natural sciences, from biology to earth sciences.

The University of Toronto's biology programme has been ranked as one of the world's top 20. The University of British Columbia's Chemistry programme is in the top 50 in the world. Other schools, like the University of Waterloo's Natural Sciences programme, offer comprehensive co-op programmes ensuring students develop valuable real-world experience before they graduate.

## Application Requirements: University of Waterloo

Let us examine the requirements needed to get into the University of Waterloo's Earth Sciences programme as a representative example.

Applicants need six Grade 12 U and/or M courses including:

- English ([ENG4U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng4u))
- [Advanced Functions (MHF4U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mhf4u)
- [Calculus and Vectors (MCV4U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mcv4u)
- At least two of: [Biology (SBI4U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sbi4u), [Chemistry (SCH4U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sch4u), [Earth and Space Science (SES4U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/ses4u), [Mathematics of Data Management (MDM4U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mdm4u), or [Physics (SPH4U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sph4u)

Minimum grades of 70% are required, with admission averages in the low 80s.

## How Canada e Academy Has You Covered

Fortunately for future natural scientists, Canada e Academy has those required courses covered:

- **ENG4U (Grade 12 English)** — required for almost all university programmes, with an emphasis on comprehension of academic language that is extremely useful when examining scientific literature.
- **MHF4U (Advanced Functions)** — refine your understanding of mathematical functions essential for success in more advanced disciplines.
- **MCV4U (Calculus and Vectors)** — grounding in vectors to model real-world relationships.
- **SBI4U (Grade 12 Biology)** — establish the biology concepts you will work with throughout your studies.
- **SCH4U (Grade 12 Chemistry)** — become familiar with organic and inorganic chemistry while developing laboratory and research skills.
- **SES4U (Earth and Space Science)** — draws on biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics to explore the dynamics affecting Earth's geology.

Canada has a vibrant environment for graduates of the natural sciences to work in. Our world-class educational institutions are providing cutting-edge research into the defining issues of the 21st century, such as climate change, food sustainability, and genetic engineering.

With smart planning, aided by academic preparation from Canada e Academy, you can establish yourself in a fulfilling and rewarding scientific career.
