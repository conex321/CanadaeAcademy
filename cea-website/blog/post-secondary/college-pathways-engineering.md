# College Pathways: Engineering

Engineering is an ever-growing and incredibly popular field of study. Those who enjoy looking at the world around them and trying to figure out the mechanics behind how things work will feel particularly drawn to it. Engineering has several different branches, allowing students a wide variety of focused disciplines to choose from.

However, many people think that to be an engineer, a university degree is required -- something that is not easily accessible to everyone. Some people interested in engineering do better with hands-on, practical courses than they do with theory, so a college programme would be a better option to help them reach their career goals.

Whichever branch of engineering appeals to you, there are several college pathways in Ontario that can help you build towards your future career.

## Manufacturing Engineering

Manufacturing engineering focuses on designing, implementing, and maintaining manufacturing systems and processes. This field of study is for students who enjoy looking at the big picture of how machines in an organisation function to produce high-quality and economically competitive products. Ontario colleges offering programmes in this area include Algonquin, Centennial, Mohawk, Fanshawe, and Conestoga.

## Mechanical Engineering

Mechanical engineering is about developing, designing, and analysing machine parts and mechanical systems. This discipline focuses on breaking down large machines into smaller parts, learning how each part is built and used, and then maintaining or improving those machines overall. Ontario colleges offering programmes in this area include George Brown, Georgian, Durham, Sault College, and Humber.

## Chemical Engineering

Chemical engineering applies the principles of chemistry, physics, and mathematics to the production and use of chemicals, materials, and energy. Students in this field learn how to develop processes for manufacturing, treating, and transporting chemicals and materials. Ontario colleges offering programmes in this area include Durham, Mohawk, Sheridan, Loyalist, and Cambrian.

## Civil Engineering

Civil engineering students learn about the design, construction, and maintenance of physical structures. This discipline is essential to creating the world around us, from necessary infrastructure like roads and bridges to the buildings we live and work in. Ontario colleges offering programmes in this area include Conestoga, Confederation, George Brown, Humber, and Seneca.

## Electrical Engineering

Electrical engineering focuses on the design and application of equipment, devices, and systems that use electricity. If civil engineering is essentially about the "bones" of our world, then electrical engineering is like the nervous system. Students in this field dive deep into understanding how electricity functions and keeps the world around us moving. Ontario colleges offering programmes in this area include Niagara, Fleming, Fanshawe, Centennial, and Algonquin.

## Computer Engineering

Computer engineering is a combination of electrical engineering and computer science with a focus on the interaction between hardware and software in computer systems. Within our modern society, technology is vital, so those who understand the language of computers and wish to build programmes that enhance our everyday interactions with them are not only needed but crucial. Ontario colleges offering programmes in this area include Sheridan, Humber, Fleming, Conestoga, and Algonquin.

## Biomedical Engineering

Biomedical engineering is the design and application of medical equipment and devices in the healthcare sector. This field of study combines knowledge of the natural system of the human body with artificial machines and tools used to help. Students in this field can learn everything from how to repair vital medical equipment to the creation and development of prosthetics and artificial organs. Ontario colleges offering programmes in this area include Durham, St. Clair, and Centennial.

## Courses You Need for College Engineering

The first step to a future career is getting accepted into a college programme. No matter the individual type of engineering you might be interested in, there are a few core courses required by most programmes.

### Core Requirements

**[ENG4C: Grade 12 College English](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng4c)**
While engineering is predominantly about math and science, having the skills needed to effectively communicate ideas and knowledge is just as important. Grade 12 College English consolidates the literacy, communication, critical thinking, and creative thinking skills necessary for success in both academic and daily life.

**[MCT4C: Grade 12 Mathematics for College Technology](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mct4c)**
This course is either recommended or required by most college engineering programmes. It builds on skills learned from Grade 11, helping to create a deep foundation of mathematical knowledge that will serve you well in your college programme.

**[SPH4C: Grade 12 College Physics](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sph4c)**
In order to take this course, you only need to have completed Grade 10 Science. However, this course is a requirement for most engineering programmes, as physics is applied to all types of engineering disciplines. You will learn basic concepts in physics, including motion, electricity, magnetism, and energy transformation.

### Alternative Math Options

**[MAP4C: Grade 12 Foundations for College Mathematics](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/map4c)**
This course will not be accepted by every engineering programme; however, it can be used as an alternative to MCT4C in some cases. This is a great option if math is not your strongest subject but you still have a desire to join an engineering programme.

**[MCR3U: Grade 11 Functions](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mcr3u)**
Some college programmes will accept Grade 11 University Math in place of a Grade 12 math course. Taking this in Grade 11 can help free up some time in Grade 12 for other courses or extracurricular activities.

### Discipline-Specific Courses

While English, math, and physics are required by almost every form of engineering, different disciplines will have additional requirements in other subject areas. Here are a few courses Canada e Academy offers that could help you secure your college acceptance:

- [SCH4C: Grade 12 College Chemistry](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sch4c)
- [ICS3U: Grade 11 Computer Science](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/ics3u)
- [ICS4U: Grade 12 Computer Science](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/ics4u)
- [SBI3U: Grade 11 Biology](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sbi3u)

No matter what type of engineering programme you might be interested in, you can get the courses you need to apply to college through [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com) and take one of many college pathways to your future career.
