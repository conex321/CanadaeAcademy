# Pathway Series: Engineering

Engineering is one of the most competitive and rewarding post-secondary pathways in Canada. From civil and mechanical engineering to software and biomedical engineering, this field offers diverse career opportunities. If you are considering engineering, your high school course selections are critical.

## What Is Engineering?

Engineers apply science, mathematics, and technology to solve real-world problems. The field is broad, with many specialisations including:

- Civil engineering
- Mechanical engineering
- Electrical and computer engineering
- Chemical engineering
- Software engineering
- Biomedical engineering
- Environmental engineering
- Aerospace engineering

## Required High School Courses

Engineering programmes at Ontario universities have some of the most specific prerequisite requirements. While exact requirements vary by school and specialisation, the following courses are almost universally required:

### Mathematics

- **[MHF4U Advanced Functions](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mhf4u)** -- Required by all engineering programmes
- **[MCV4U Calculus and Vectors](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mcv4u)** -- Required by all engineering programmes

### Science

- **[SPH4U Physics](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sph4u)** -- Required by all engineering programmes
- **[SCH4U Chemistry](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sch4u)** -- Required by most engineering programmes

### English

- **[ENG4U English](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng4u)** -- Required by all Ontario university programmes

### Additional Recommendations

- **[SBI4U Biology](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sbi4u)** -- Recommended for biomedical engineering
- **[ICS4U Computer Science](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/ics4u)** -- Recommended for software and computer engineering
- **[MDM4U Data Management](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mdm4u)** -- Useful for data-driven engineering fields

## Competitive Averages

Engineering programmes at top Ontario universities typically require admission averages of 85% to 95% or higher, depending on the school and specialisation. Strong marks in mathematics and physics are particularly important.

If your current marks are not competitive enough, consider [upgrading your courses](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses) at Canada e Academy. Since universities typically consider your highest mark in a course, upgrading can significantly improve your application.

## Supplementary Applications

Some engineering programmes require supplementary applications. For example, the University of Waterloo's engineering faculty requires an Admission Information Form (AIF) and the Euclid Mathematics Contest. Research the specific requirements for each programme you are applying to.

## Planning Ahead

If engineering is your goal, start planning early:

- Take Grade 11 university-preparation courses in math and science to prepare for the Grade 12 prerequisites
- Participate in STEM-related extracurriculars and competitions
- Seek out engineering-related volunteer or work experience
- Research specific programme requirements at your target universities
