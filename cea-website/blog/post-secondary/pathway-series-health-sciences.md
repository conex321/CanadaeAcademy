# Pathway Series: Health Sciences

A career in health sciences can lead to some of the most rewarding and in-demand professions in Canada, from nursing and physiotherapy to public health and biomedical research. If you are considering a future in this field, the courses you choose in high school play an important role in preparing you for post-secondary success.

## What Are the Health Sciences?

The health sciences encompass a broad range of disciplines focused on understanding the human body, preventing and treating illness, and promoting overall well-being. Career paths in this field include:

- Medicine and surgery
- Nursing
- Pharmacy
- Physiotherapy and kinesiology
- Public health
- Biomedical science and research
- Nutrition and dietetics
- Occupational therapy
- Veterinary science

## Key High School Courses

While specific requirements vary by university and programme, the following courses are commonly required or recommended for health sciences programmes:

### Science Courses

- **[SBI4U Biology](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sbi4u)** -- Required by nearly all health sciences programmes. Topics include biochemistry, genetics, and human anatomy.
- **[SCH4U Chemistry](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sch4u)** -- Essential for understanding pharmacology, biochemistry, and molecular biology.
- **[SPH4U Physics](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sph4u)** -- Required by some programmes, particularly those related to biomedical engineering or radiation therapy.

### Mathematics Courses

- **[MHF4U Advanced Functions](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mhf4u)** -- Required by most science-based university programmes.
- **[MCV4U Calculus and Vectors](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mcv4u)** -- Required by some programmes, especially those with a strong quantitative component.
- **[MDM4U Data Management](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mdm4u)** -- Useful for public health and research-oriented programmes.

### Recommended Electives

- **[PSK4U Kinesiology](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/psk4u)** -- Provides a foundation in human movement and physical activity.
- **[HFA4U Food and Nutrition Science](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/hfa4u)** -- Explores nutrition, food science, and healthy eating.

## Planning Your Course Load

If you are interested in health sciences, it is important to plan your course selections carefully, starting in Grade 11. Make sure you are taking the prerequisite courses needed for your target programmes. If you are missing a prerequisite or want to upgrade a mark, [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/) offers all of the courses listed above in a self-paced online format.

## Supplementary Applications

Many health sciences programmes require supplementary applications, which may include:

- Personal essays or statements of interest
- CASPer tests (situational judgement tests)
- Interviews
- Volunteer or work experience documentation

Start preparing for these early, and take advantage of volunteer opportunities in healthcare settings to strengthen your application.
