# Pathway Series: Computer Science

Computer science is one of the fastest-growing fields in Canada, with strong job prospects and high demand for graduates. Whether you are interested in software development, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, or game design, a computer science degree provides a versatile foundation. Here is how to prepare.

## What Can You Do with a Computer Science Degree?

The career opportunities are vast and continue to expand:

- Software development and engineering
- Data science and analytics
- Artificial intelligence and machine learning
- Cybersecurity
- Web and mobile application development
- Game design and development
- Cloud computing and DevOps
- Research and academia

## Key High School Courses

### Mathematics

Mathematics is the backbone of computer science. The following courses are required by most programmes:

- **[MHF4U Advanced Functions](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mhf4u)** -- Required
- **[MCV4U Calculus and Vectors](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mcv4u)** -- Required by most programmes

### Computer Science

While not always a formal prerequisite, taking computer science in high school gives you a significant advantage:

- **[ICS3U Introduction to Computer Science](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/ics3u)** -- Builds programming fundamentals
- **[ICS4U Computer Science](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/ics4u)** -- Explores advanced programming concepts

### English

- **[ENG4U English](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng4u)** -- Required by all Ontario university programmes

### Recommended Electives

- **[MDM4U Data Management](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mdm4u)** -- Covers statistics and probability, directly applicable to data science
- **[SPH4U Physics](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sph4u)** -- Useful for game development and computational physics

## Competitive Averages

Computer science programmes at top Ontario universities are very competitive. The University of Waterloo's computer science programme, for example, often requires averages above 95%. Other programmes may require averages in the mid-80s to low 90s.

Strong mathematics marks are especially important, as admissions committees pay close attention to your performance in MHF4U and MCV4U.

## Supplementary Applications and Contests

Some computer science programmes require or recommend:

- Written personal statements or video interviews
- Participation in math contests (such as Euclid, CEMC competitions, or AMC)
- Coding competitions or hackathons
- Personal programming projects or portfolios

If you plan to apply to competitive programmes, start participating in contests and building projects early.

## Building Your Profile

Beyond grades, computer science programmes value students who demonstrate:

- Independent learning and curiosity about technology
- Personal coding projects (apps, websites, games, or open-source contributions)
- Participation in coding clubs, hackathons, or tech communities
- Problem-solving skills demonstrated through math and science competitions

## Plan Ahead

Computer science prerequisites start in Grade 11, so plan your course selections early. If you need to take or upgrade a prerequisite, [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/) offers all the required courses in a self-paced online format.
