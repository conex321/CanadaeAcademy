# Ontario College Pathways: Courses You Need to Apply

For high school students planning for post-secondary, a lot of emphasis is placed on applying to university programmes, and there is plenty of assistance from teachers and guidance counsellors in that department.

However, not every student seeks to attend a university programme. Many hope to apply to college or trade school instead. Yet, there does not seem to be as much support or easily accessible information for many of these students, which can make the process challenging.

Attaining a college education is just as important and valid as attending a university programme. Colleges tend to be less theory-focused and instead allow students a more hands-on learning style, which helps teach them the necessary skills for future career paths.

At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com), our goal is to help students achieve success in whatever pathway they choose. Below, you will find information to help you understand your options, courses that you can take, and how to follow your pathway to post-secondary success at a college programme.

## Broad Programme Options

Many students are not aware of just how many programmes and pathways can be found by attending college. Perhaps you do not know specifically what college programme or career path might be right for you, but knowing what general options there are can help you narrow it down. Below is a list of general subject areas you can pursue with a college programme:

- Agriculture
- Education, Community, and Social Services
- Fire, Justice, and Security
- Professions and Trades
- Arts and Cultures
- Environmental and Natural Resources
- Health Sciences, including programmes like Nursing or Nutrition
- Transportation and Logistics
- Business
- Culinary and Hospitality
- Engineering and Technology
- Media

These are just some general categories that encompass many additional programmes that are more specialised. You can explore more specific programmes through the [Ontario Colleges Application Service](https://www.ontariocolleges.ca/en/programs).

## Applying to College

For students looking to attend an Ontario college, you can apply through one centralised system: the [Ontario College Application Service (OCAS)](https://www.ontariocolleges.ca/en). Both Canadian and international students can apply to colleges through this service.

This platform helps you create an account, review and update college applications, request Ontario high school transcripts, request Ontario college and university transcripts, and view and accept offers of admission from Ontario colleges. It also has a centralised database where you can search different programmes and find colleges.

To make things even easier, OCAS has a mobile app as well, which includes all the features available on the desktop application. You can check your application status, update your account, and do research from wherever you are, at any time.

Canada e Academy can help students with their OCAS applications by submitting records and transcripts directly to OCAS. We are able to do this whether you are a current high school student or a mature student who is now looking to apply to college.

## General Courses for College

If you are still trying to decide on your future college programme and do not have a specific one in mind, having a general idea of the subject you might like to study can guide your course selection. Here are several general courses that Canada e Academy offers which can be applied to a multitude of college programmes.

### English

English is first and foremost. It does not matter if you are going to college or university -- you are required to have a Grade 12 English in order to graduate, and it is also a requirement for all Canadian colleges and universities.

For students planning to attend college, at minimum you will need to complete [ENG4C (Grade 12 College English)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng4c). However, if you want to take [ENG4U (Grade 12 University English)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng4u), you can do so as well, and it will absolutely be accepted for any college programme.

### Sciences

There are several college programmes that fit under the science category, covering everything from health and veterinary sciences to engineering and beyond. If you are passionate about the sciences, there are several options you can take that apply to a variety of programmes and provide a strong foundation for future studies.

At Canada e Academy, we offer both [SPH4C (Grade 12 College Physics)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sph4c) and [SCH4C (Grade 12 College Chemistry)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sch4c). Both subjects only require that you have completed Grade 10 Science. We also offer the university-level versions of these subjects, though those require the Grade 11 prerequisite in the same subject. Either option can be used for a college application.

It is important to note that not all college programmes require Grade 12 science courses. Many colleges will accept Grade 11 College or University-level courses for admission. At Canada e Academy, we offer Biology ([SBI3U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sbi3u) and [SBI3C](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sbi3c)), Chemistry ([SCH3U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sch3u)), and Physics ([SPH3U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sph3u)) in Grade 11.

### Math

Several college programmes, such as Health Science, Engineering, Computer Science, and Business, among others, will require you to take math in high school in order to prepare you for the courses you will be taking in post-secondary.

Depending on the programme, you might be required to have either a Grade 11 or a Grade 12 math course. Some college programmes may require the university-level math; however, for most, a college level is the minimum requirement. At Canada e Academy, we offer several math courses that would meet your needs:

- [Grade 11 Functions (MCR3U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mcr3u)
- [Grade 11 Functions and Applications (MCF3M)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mcf3m)
- [Grade 11 Foundations for College Mathematics (MBF3C)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mbf3c)
- [Grade 12 Foundations for College Mathematics (MAP4C)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/map4c)
- [Grade 12 Mathematics for College Technology (MCT4C)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mct4c)
- [Grade 12 Advanced Functions (MHF4U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mhf4u)
- [Grade 12 Calculus and Vectors (MCV4U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mcv4u)
- [Grade 12 Mathematics of Data Management (MDM4U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mdm4u)

All of the above are general foundational courses for a variety of programmes, so even if you are not sure what your plan is yet for college, you can still take courses aimed towards your potential goals.

At Canada e Academy, we want all of our students to achieve their goals -- not just by earning high grades in their courses, but by making sure they are taking the courses they need and have the information required to make informed decisions about their post-secondary future.
