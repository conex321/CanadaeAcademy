# OSSD vs GED (CAEC): What Is the Difference?

If you are no longer attending a regular high school but have not graduated yet, you may be trying to figure out what your next move is for your education. You may be considering college, university, or a trade, and wonder which is the best option to help you get to where you need to go: the OSSD or a GED. What exactly is the difference? And which one is needed for certain post-secondary pathways?

## What Is the Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD)?

The OSSD -- Ontario Secondary School Diploma -- is what you earn after completing high school in Ontario. It has a [list of requirements](https://www.ontario.ca/page/earning-your-high-school-diploma) that include a total of 30 credits, 40 volunteer hours, and a passing score on the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test (OSSLT). This typically takes students four years to complete, although it can take longer for some, or can be completed in less time with Canada e Academy.

## What Is the General Education Development (GED) Test?

The General Educational Development (GED) -- [now renamed the Canadian Adult Education Credential (CAEC)](https://www.ontario.ca/page/adult-learning-canadian-adult-education-credential-caec) -- is a test adults can take to earn an Ontario High School Equivalency Certificate. Essentially, this tells employers and colleges that you have similar knowledge to what high school graduates have.

Students will write the test over approximately 7.5 hours, covering five sections: reading (50 questions), writing (one persuasive writing task), mathematics (42 questions), science (35 questions), and social studies (40 questions). The test costs $100 to write all five sections and students must receive at least 55% in each section to pass.

## Which Is Right for Me?

While the GED/CAEC may be appealing because it is fast and inexpensive, it can be limiting in what you can do with it. If you plan to attend university or college, you will likely be required to earn the OSSD. Many university programmes have specific requirements, like certain credits or grade averages that must be earned. In these cases, the GED/CAEC will not be sufficient.

Trade schools, the military, or jobs that require no post-secondary education are more likely to accept a GED/CAEC.

The OSSD offers many more options for careers and post-secondary institutions, so many people consider it to be worth the time investment. Earning the OSSD means you are more likely to be accepted into college or university and to gain employment from jobs that offer higher than minimum wages.

## Conclusion

[Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/) offers many different courses that allow students to earn their OSSD entirely online, if that is what best suits them. An OSSD from Canada e Academy is the same as one from other Ontario high schools, meaning our students have a high acceptance rate into post-secondary institutions. Canada e Academy offers similar flexibility that a GED/CAEC does, and can help you achieve your post-secondary goals.
