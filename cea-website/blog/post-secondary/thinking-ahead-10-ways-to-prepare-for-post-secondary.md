# Thinking Ahead: 10 Ways to Prepare for Post-Secondary Today

It is never too early to start thinking about your post-secondary future. Whether you are in Grade 9 or Grade 12, there are steps you can take right now to set yourself up for success. Here are 10 practical ways to prepare for college or university while you are still in high school.

## 1. Research Your Options Early

Start exploring post-secondary programmes, schools, and career paths early. Visit university websites, attend virtual open houses, and talk to people in fields that interest you. The more you know about your options, the better equipped you will be to make informed decisions.

## 2. Take the Right Courses

Many post-secondary programmes have specific high school course prerequisites. Make sure you understand what courses you need and plan your schedule accordingly. The [guidance team at Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/guidance) can help you map out a course plan that aligns with your goals.

## 3. Focus on Your Grades

While grades are not everything, they do matter for post-secondary admission. Put consistent effort into your coursework and seek help when you are struggling. If you need to improve a grade, consider taking an [upgrade course](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/upgrade-courses) online.

## 4. Develop Strong Study Habits

The study habits you build in high school will carry you through post-secondary. Learn how to manage your time, take effective notes, and prepare for exams. These skills will be even more important when you are managing the increased workload of college or university.

## 5. Get Involved in Extracurricular Activities

Universities and colleges value well-rounded students. Participate in activities that interest you, whether that is sports, arts, clubs, or volunteer work. These experiences not only look good on applications but also help you develop important skills.

## 6. Complete Your Community Service Hours

The OSSD requires 40 hours of community involvement. Do not leave these to the last minute. Find volunteer opportunities that align with your interests and career goals, and complete them well before your graduation year.

## 7. Build Relationships with Your Teachers

Your teachers can be valuable resources for recommendation letters, academic guidance, and career advice. Make an effort to engage with your teachers and let them get to know you as a student.

## 8. Start a Scholarship Search Early

Scholarships and bursaries can significantly reduce the cost of post-secondary education. Start searching for opportunities early and keep track of application deadlines. Websites like [Scholarships Canada](https://www.scholarshipscanada.com/) list hundreds of opportunities each year.

## 9. Learn to Write Well

Strong writing skills are essential for post-secondary success, regardless of your programme. Take courses like [ENG4U English](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng4u) or [EWC4U Writer's Craft](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/ewc4u) to develop your writing abilities.

## 10. Take Care of Your Mental Health

The transition to post-secondary can be stressful. Start building healthy habits now -- regular exercise, adequate sleep, and stress management techniques will serve you well in the years ahead.
