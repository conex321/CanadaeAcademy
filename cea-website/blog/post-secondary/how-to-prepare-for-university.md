# How to Prepare for University

It happens every year. Students find themselves finally on track to complete high school, maybe they have even already gained acceptance to a university, but then they find themselves worrying about how to be prepared. How does one actually prepare for attending a university? How do I know if I am ready?

It is perfectly normal to not feel ready for university, but that does not mean you have to stress yourself out over it! To help you prepare, [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/) has created an easy-to-follow checklist.

## Ensure You Meet All Relevant Deadlines

While still busy with high school work, it can be easy to lose track of various [deadlines for university applications](https://www.ouac.on.ca/planning/deadlines/), but meeting all these deadlines is essential. It is possible to have excellent grades but miss important opportunities simply due to missed deadlines.

Even after graduation, when you are busy enjoying your summer break, there might be further dates you have to think about, such as when your course selection opens. Once you start university, deadlines for dropping courses are very strict.

## Plan Your Programme of Study Carefully

Often students get so caught up in worrying about what school they will go to that they pay less attention to what specific programme they want to enter. Different programmes may seem similar but lead to different degrees. Do you want to study psychology or psychiatry? The difference is important. Maybe you are interested in all STEM fields, but now it is time for you to make a choice and focus on one.

## Choose Your Courses Carefully

Once you are accepted to a programme, you still need to choose your courses. Depending on your programme, you may have a great deal of freedom in your course selection, but you must ensure that the courses you pick are moving you toward your degree goals. You should also consider your schedule when picking courses.

## Consider Visiting the University Before Your Classes Begin

Some students may find themselves able to visit the university before classes begin. Many universities have [days scheduled for showing new students around](https://future.utoronto.ca/newly-admitted-students/orientation/). Even without these tours, you can simply show up and start finding your way around campus. Learn the landmarks, find where your classes will be, and perhaps most importantly, make yourself comfortable.
