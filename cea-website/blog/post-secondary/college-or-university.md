# College or University? Considering Your Post-Secondary Options

As you work towards graduation, you are probably beginning to think about your next chapter. Deciding what to do after high school can be a daunting prospect. One of the first major choices is deciding whether you want to apply to college, university, or both.

As an established online high school that has helped hundreds of students earn their [Ontario Secondary School Diploma](https://canadaeacademy.com/ossd-requirements), [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com) can help you through this important decision-making process. Our [guidance team](https://canadaeacademy.com/guidance) maintains up-to-date information on application deadlines and procedures for both college and university, and they are available for one-on-one consultation.

## College or University?

Some may wonder, what is the difference between college and university, anyway? Typically, universities cater to more theoretical disciplines (Languages, Philosophy, Mathematics), while colleges cater to more hands-on, job-ready field training (Nursing, Business Administration, Dentistry).

Many also wonder: is one better than the other? The answer depends on the field you are looking to enter. With a focus on hands-on training, colleges can prepare students for direct access to different job markets in less time than the average university degree. Yet, many top-paying fields require university degrees, so students pursuing those fields may find university their necessary path.

## Why Not Both?

It is important to note a third, less discussed option: applying to both. More and more students are finding that starting with a two-year college programme is a great way to bridge the often-cited gap between the rigour of high school and that of university. There are also an increasing number of programmes offered as joint ventures between reputable colleges and universities, offering students the opportunity to experience hands-on benefits of college programming in addition to the in-depth classroom studies common of universities.

In the end, it comes down to deciding what field, and what style of learning, is right for you. Are you a hands-on learner, eager to enter the workforce and start earning? Then college may be the best fit. Are you a more theoretical thinker, determined to work in a particular field even if it means more years of study? Then university may be the path to get you there.
