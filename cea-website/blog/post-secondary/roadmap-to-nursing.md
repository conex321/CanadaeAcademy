# From Pathway to Profession: Your Roadmap to Nursing

Nurses are the backbone of our healthcare system and play a vital role in our communities. With healthcare needs on the rise, the demand for qualified nurses has never been higher. Choosing a career in nursing is an admirable and rewarding decision. If you are exploring how to become a nurse and are feeling a bit overwhelmed by the options, you are not alone. There are several pathways to nursing in Ontario, and understanding them is key to making the best choices for your future.

## Types of Nursing

### Registered Practical Nurses (RPNs) or Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs)

- **Education:** 2-year diploma from an Ontario college (4 semesters)
- **Licensing:** Must pass the Canadian Practical Nurse Registration Examination (CPNRE)
- **Work settings:** Long-term care, rehabilitation centres, community clinics, and hospital units with stable patient conditions
- **Note:** RPNs provide essential care but typically work under the supervision of an RN or physician.

### Registered Nurses (RNs)

- **Education:** 4-year university degree — either a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BScN) or a Bachelor of Nursing (BN)
- **Licensing:** Must pass the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX-RN)
- **Work settings:** Hospitals (ICU, ER, surgical units), public health, community health, and leadership roles
- **Note:** RNs have a broader scope of practice, including high autonomy in assessment, planning, and clinical decision-making.

### Nurse Practitioners (NPs)
