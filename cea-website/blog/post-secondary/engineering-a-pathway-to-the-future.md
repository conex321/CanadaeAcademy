# Engineering: A Pathway to the Future

The path to higher education opens after you graduate high school. Whether you want to enter academia through university or pursue hands-on career training via a college programme, you need to have a high school diploma first.

For students committed to STEM education at the university level, you will need to focus on stellar marks and the right study habits. At Canada e Academy, we are committed to helping you achieve your goals, and so we will be looking at one STEM discipline in particular — Engineering — and what high school students can do to prepare for post-secondary study in this field.

Engineering is a regulated profession in Canada, and only certain post-secondary institutions can offer the appropriate programmes and courses. Some of these institutions are very competitive. For example, the University of Toronto says that grades in the mid to high 90s are recommended to be a competitive applicant for its Engineering Science programme.

There is no need to be disheartened though — a little preparation goes a long way. Online learning, like that offered by Canada e Academy, provides a great opportunity to cover the necessary credits at your own pace.

## Canada's World-Class Engineering Schools

Canada has several world-class institutions available for future engineers:

- **University of Toronto** — ranked first in Canada for Engineering, with an Entrepreneurship Hatchery that allows students to create and develop startups while still at school.
- **University of Waterloo** — Canada's largest Engineering school, in the top 50 worldwide, and named by Maclean's as the most innovative school in Canada for 27 years running.
- **McGill University** — also in the top 50, with regular traineeships for undergrads to get involved with faculty research projects during their summers.
- **University of British Columbia** — over 4,500 employer partnerships, allowing undergrads to get real-world experience during their studies.

## A Closer Look: University of Waterloo

In their first year, students at the University of Waterloo develop the foundational knowledge they will use in the future, mostly focused on building the necessary mathematics and science skills. Unlike some schools, Waterloo offers direct-entry programmes, ensuring students get a specialised programme in their chosen field from day one.

Waterloo also provides the world's largest collection of co-op programmes. Each Engineering programme at Waterloo is different, but generally, students alternate between school and work every four to eight months. On average, students earn $17,000 per work term across six work terms.

## Application Requirements

Let us take a look at one of Waterloo's Engineering programme application requirements. The Civil Engineering programme requires six Grade 12 U and/or M courses including Advanced Functions, Calculus and Vectors, Chemistry, Physics, and English. All courses must be at least 70%, but to be competitive, these marks need to be much higher. An average grade of 95% and above has an 85% chance of receiving an offer.

## How Canada e Academy Can Help You Get There

The flexibility offered by online learning can allow you to develop and learn at your own pace. At Canada e Academy, we offer Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD) high school courses online, and we are inspected by the Ontario Ministry of Education.

We can help you achieve results in the courses necessary for entry:

- [MHF4U — Advanced Functions](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mhf4u): Refine your understanding of mathematical functions, essential for success in more advanced mathematical disciplines.
- [MCV4U — Calculus and Vectors](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mcv4u): Build the grounding in vectors to model real-world relationships.
- [SPH4U — Physics](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sph4u): Foundational knowledge of energy transformation and scientific investigation.
- [SCH4U — Chemistry](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sch4u): Knowledge of chemical processes essential for many Engineering concepts.

Your marks in these courses can be sent directly to OCAS or OUAC, making it easy to integrate them into college or university applications.

There are career paths in Engineering for any possible interest or passion, and many of them are in some of the most well-paid fields in Canada. With preparation, a plan, and hard work, post-secondary Engineering education is attainable, and at Canada e Academy we offer world-class academic preparation to help you get into the school of your dreams.
