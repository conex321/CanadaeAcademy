# What Is Reach Ahead and How Does It Work?

Starting high school can be both exciting and overwhelming. Between new subjects, new routines, and new expectations, there is a lot to adjust to. But what if you could get a head start? That is exactly what Reach Ahead programmes are designed to do.

## What Is Reach Ahead?

Reach Ahead is an opportunity for Grade 8 students to begin earning high school credits before they officially start Grade 9. By completing one or two high school courses in advance, students can ease their transition to high school and free up space in their timetable for the courses they are most interested in.

At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/), our Reach Ahead programme allows Grade 8 students to enrol in select [Grade 9 courses](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses) and complete them online at their own pace.

## How Does It Work?

1. **Choose a course:** Students typically select a compulsory Grade 9 course such as [Geography (CGC1W)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/cgc1w), [French (FSF1O)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/fsf1o), or [Healthy Active Living (PPL1O)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/ppl1o).
2. **Register and enrol:** With parental consent, students register with Canada e Academy and gain access to their course.
3. **Complete the course:** Students work through the course at their own pace, with support from their teacher.
4. **Earn the credit:** Upon successful completion, the credit is added to the student's Ontario Student Transcript (OST).

## Benefits of Reaching Ahead

### Lighter Course Load in Grade 9

By completing one or two credits before Grade 9 begins, students have more room in their timetable. This can mean fewer courses per semester, more time for each subject, or the opportunity to add electives.

### Smoother Transition

The transition from elementary to high school is a big adjustment. Completing a high school course in advance helps students become familiar with the expectations and format of high school coursework, making the transition less daunting.

### Explore Interests Earlier

With compulsory courses already taken care of, students have more freedom to explore elective courses that align with their interests and potential career paths.

### Build Confidence

Successfully completing a high school course before Grade 9 is a significant accomplishment that can boost a student's confidence and motivation.

## Is Reach Ahead Right for Your Child?

Reach Ahead is ideal for motivated Grade 8 students who are looking for a challenge and want to get ahead. However, it is important that students are ready for the increased expectations of high school-level work.
