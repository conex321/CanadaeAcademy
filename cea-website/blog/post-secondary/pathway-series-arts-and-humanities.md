# Pathway Series: Arts and Humanities

The arts and humanities encompass some of the most diverse and intellectually stimulating programmes available at Ontario universities. From English literature and history to philosophy, political science, and fine arts, these disciplines develop critical thinking, communication, and analytical skills that are valued across every industry.

## What Are the Arts and Humanities?

The arts and humanities cover a broad range of disciplines, including:

- English literature and creative writing
- History and classical studies
- Philosophy and ethics
- Political science and international relations
- Sociology and anthropology
- Psychology
- Visual and performing arts
- Film and media studies
- Indigenous studies
- Gender and equity studies

## Career Opportunities

A common misconception is that arts and humanities degrees do not lead to careers. In reality, graduates find success in a wide range of fields:

- Law and public policy
- Journalism and media
- Education and teaching
- Public relations and communications
- Non-profit and social services
- Government and diplomacy
- Publishing and editing
- Arts administration and curation
- Human resources and management

The critical thinking, research, and communication skills developed in arts and humanities programmes are highly transferable.
