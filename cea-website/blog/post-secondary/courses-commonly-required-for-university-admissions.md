# Courses Commonly Required for Undergraduate University Admissions

For students in Grade 11 and 12, it is important to start planning ahead to your post-secondary applications when it comes to selecting your courses. Unlike Grade 9 and 10, where the majority of your courses are compulsory subjects, Grade 11 and 12 offers far more elective options and choice. It can be daunting to try and select courses both based on the subjects you find interesting and the courses you will need in order to apply to the post-secondary school of your choice.

In this article, we will discuss the common requirements for most programmes depending on your major.

## General Subjects

Before we take a look at individual majors, it is important to discuss some common courses that are required by a variety of programmes.

**[Grade 12 English -- ENG4U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng4u)**

Grade 12 English is a requirement for all high school students to graduate; however, there are different levels of Grade 12 English, including university, college, and workplace. It does not matter what university programme you are applying to -- Grade 12 University level English is a requirement for every university programme.

**[Grade 12 Advanced Functions -- MHF4U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mhf4u)**

This course is required by several different types of majors, including but not limited to Engineering, Health Sciences (including Nursing), Computer Science, and Business.
