# Pathway Series: Business and Commerce

Business and commerce programmes are among the most popular choices for Ontario university applicants. Whether you dream of working in finance, marketing, entrepreneurship, or management, a strong foundation in high school sets you up for success. Here is what you need to know.

## What Can You Do with a Business Degree?

A business or commerce degree opens doors to a wide range of careers, including:

- Accounting and finance
- Marketing and advertising
- Human resources
- Management consulting
- Entrepreneurship and start-ups
- Supply chain and logistics
- Real estate
- International business and trade

## Key High School Courses

While specific requirements vary by university, the following courses are commonly required or strongly recommended:

### Mathematics

- **[MDM4U Data Management](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mdm4u)** -- Useful for programmes with a focus on analytics or data-driven decision-making

### English

## Competitive Averages

Admission to top business programmes in Ontario (such as those at Queen's, Ivey, Rotman, or Schulich) is highly competitive, often requiring averages of 88% or higher. Strong marks in mathematics and English are particularly important.

If you need to improve your marks, [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/) offers upgrade courses that allow you to retake a course and aim for a higher grade.

## Supplementary Applications

Many business programmes require supplementary applications, which may include:

- Video essays or recorded interviews
- Written personal statements
- Case study analyses
- Descriptions of extracurricular activities and leadership experience

Start preparing these early, as they often carry significant weight in the admission decision.

## Building Your Profile

Beyond academics, business schools value leadership, initiative, and real-world experience. Consider:

- Starting or leading a school club
- Volunteering in your community
- Working a part-time job (especially in customer-facing or leadership roles)
- Participating in business competitions (such as DECA or Junior Achievement)
