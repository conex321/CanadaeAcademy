# Why Brain Breaks Are Essential for Online Learners

You are staring at your [Grade 12 Advanced Functions course (MHF4U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mhf4u), the words and numbers are blurring together, and you are pretty sure you have already read that last sentence twice. Sound familiar? Studying is essential, but it does not need to be painful. Some methods support your brain, while others can lead to burnout. At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com), we are here to help you develop effective study habits for online high school, and yes, that includes brain breaks.

But before you toss your books aside and start scrolling, let us define what a brain break actually is.

A brain break is a simple physical or mental exercise designed to refresh your focus. These short, purposeful activities help rebalance neural activity and combat mental fatigue, something your social media feeds cannot provide. Extended study sessions can wear down your prefrontal cortex (the part of your brain responsible for concentration and decision-making), causing it to fatigue. A well-timed and structured brain break helps reset that region and restore your ability to concentrate. Even a brief pause helps shift your attention inward and re-energise your brain.

## Brain Breaks Are Not Just for Classrooms

Teachers have long known the value of brain breaks and they are a regular part of in-person learning. What some fail to realise is that for the world of online education, they are just as crucial. At Canada e Academy, we do not just deliver a comprehensive curriculum — we also support the whole learner.

So, what does an effective brain break look like in online learning environments? There are two key elements: timing and activity.

## Timing

When it comes to effective brain breaks, timing is important. It refers not only to how long the brain break is, but also when you should take it. While everyone is different, a general rule of thumb is for every 20 to 30 minutes of studying, take a three-to-five-minute brain break. If you feel you can go for 40 minutes, study for 40 minutes then take a 10-minute brain break — just enough time for a walk. With our self-paced courses, you do not have to worry about strict deadlines and can focus on doing your best.

## Activity

Unlike the group games you might find in a classroom, brain breaks for online learners are often solo activities. But that does not mean they are boring. Try the following:

- **A walk:** Walking has been shown to improve your mood, sleep quality, energy levels, and stress — all things that fuel better learning.
- **Yoga:** No need for a personal instructor; YouTube has countless short yoga videos perfect for a quick break.
- **Music:** Listening to songs that make you feel good can boost your motivation. Bonus points if you can dance for an added body break.
- **Puzzles:** Whether it is a puzzle with pieces or just a problem for your brain to solve, like a crossword or word search, puzzles can enhance your mood by releasing dopamine, which regulates mood, memory, and concentration.
- **Clean up:** Whether it is your workspace, room, or the house, put on some good music, set a timer, and start tidying.

## Signs You Need a Brain Break

Brain breaks also contribute to increasing your self-awareness. Recognising when you need a break can lead you to discover what time you can focus best in the day and what kinds of study breaks work best for you. Here are some signs it may be time:

- You are having to re-read the same sentence over and over but not registering the words
- You are starting to fall asleep or your fatigue is affecting your concentration
- You are starting to feel sore from sitting
- You are daydreaming more than normal
- You are fidgeting more than you typically do
- You have a headache and/or sore eyes
- You are starting to feel more irritated than normal

## Do Not Feel Guilty — Step Away to Succeed

Taking a brain break does not have to mean procrastination; it can be smart learning. When used intentionally, brain breaks do not just help you refocus in the moment — they also strengthen your long-term learning habits.

Is online high school effective? The answer is yes, especially when you develop skills like time management, self-awareness, and balance. Taking breaks is one of those skills. So go ahead, lace up your runners and go for a walk. Your learning (and [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com)) will be there when you get back.
