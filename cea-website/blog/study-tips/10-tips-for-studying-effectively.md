# 10 Tips for Studying Effectively

There is no denying that studying is an essential part of schooling, or that the study habits you develop now will stay with you throughout your educational career. Unfortunately, many students still believe that cramming is the be-all end-all study strategy, but just as many learn (the hard way) that it is definitely not. Fortunately, we have put together a guide to help you study effectively and productively without burning yourself out. Test out these 10 suggestions and see what works best for you.

## 1. Stay Organised

Whether it is your workspace, your schedule, or your notes, staying organised is essential for effective studying. While studying, you want to maximise your ability to focus, and this can be difficult to do if you are constantly searching for notes or debating which task you should work on. Having a comprehensive organisational system in place allows you to work and study efficiently, increasing your productivity and minimising your stress.

## 2. Ask Questions

If you find yourself struggling to understand a concept, it can be easy to get stuck on it and lose valuable time trying to figure it out solo. A good principle to follow is: when in doubt, reach out. Whether it is your teacher, a peer, or a parent, asking clarifying questions can make even the most complicated concepts clearer. Be sure to take advantage of your teacher's office hours to receive real-time explanations and feedback.

## 3. Focus on One Task at a Time

However tempting it may be, avoid multi-tasking. Our brains are not wired to process two dissimilar tasks at the same time. Studying for two exams simultaneously will likely result in your remembering little to nothing about either subject. Instead, focus on one task at a time, and allow your brain to fully process the information you are working on.

## 4. Do Not Cram

Everyone is guilty of procrastinating to the point of last-minute cramming at some point or another, but making it a habit is a recipe for chaos. The increased stress that comes with cramming negatively affects your brain's ability to concentrate, making studying that much more difficult. Additionally, cramming often leads students to skip out on sleep, which is essential for retaining information. Spreading out your studies over a longer period of time is a far more effective study method.

## 5. Pay Attention to What Works for You

Different people have different study habits. Unfortunately, there is no way to know exactly what will work best for you until you test it out. If studying effectively is something you struggle with, it might be time to try a new method. By trying out a variety of different strategies, you will be able to determine what works and what does not.

## 6. Time of Day Is Important

Are you a morning person or a night owl? Whichever camp you fall under, it is important to study when you feel most alert. Likewise, it is important to keep your schedule consistent. If you try to study when you are distracted or tired, you will end up working harder to retain less information.

## 7. Test Yourself

Take some time after each main concept to self-check whether you have really learned the information. Put away your notes and explain the concept as you would to someone who had never heard of it before. This exercise is extremely effective in showing you which parts of a topic you have a solid grasp on and which you need to review.

## 8. Sleep Well

Never underestimate the power of a good night's sleep. While you are asleep, your brain stays busy solidifying new information. When you skip out on sleep, the connections in your brain cannot function properly and it becomes difficult to recall information, learn new material, and think abstractly. Your ability to focus and pay attention is also affected by the amount of sleep you get, so make sure you are getting a full night's rest.

## 9. Take a Break

Taking breaks is essential in maintaining your ability to focus while studying. No one can effectively concentrate on new information for hours on end, so allow yourself to step away every hour to give your brain a break. This will also help keep you motivated and increase your productivity during the time you do spend studying.

## 10. Take Advantage of Downtime

While school (and life) can get chaotic at times, there are also bound to be periods where there is not much going on. Whether due dates are far away, or it is too soon to start studying for tests and exams, take advantage of this downtime. Tackle small assignments, readings, or get a head start on your study notes for an upcoming test. Whatever you choose to do, make it something your future self will thank you for come finals season.
