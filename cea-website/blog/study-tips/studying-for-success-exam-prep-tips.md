# Studying for Success: Tips for Exam Prep

Summer is just around the corner, but first, the dreaded exam season must be tackled. Here are some quick tips to help you study for success.

## Know What You Are in For

Ask your teacher what format the exam is going to take and how the sections are going to be weighted. Studying for multiple choice looks very different from studying for long answer response. Knowing what to expect come exam day can go a long way towards alleviating test anxiety.

## Get Organised

Make sure you have all the notes and study materials you need for each exam you are taking. If you missed a lesson, reach out to a classmate for their notes or ask your teacher to go over the material with you. Organise your notes by subject and by unit, taking care to exclude anything your teacher has guaranteed will not be tested.

## Prioritise Your Exams

While you will want to schedule time to study for all of your exams, the amount of study time each exam requires does not necessarily have to be the same. Evaluate all of your exams according to the following factors before creating your study schedule:

- Your existing comfort level with the course content
- The weight of the exam
- Your current standing in the course
- When the exam is taking place

## Break It Up (or at Least Take Regular Breaks)

Breaking your studying up over time helps give your brain time to process the material. If you simply must cram, be sure to at least take frequent study breaks to help keep your mind focused. Stand up and stretch, grab a glass of water and a nutritious snack, play with your pet, then head back to hit the books some more. A few active minutes every hour can go a long way.

## Teach Someone

The act of teaching intrinsically reinforces the act of learning. Pick a partner and teach them the toughest concept on your study guide. The simple act of explaining a concept out loud, just as you would to another person, can help you identify holes in your knowledge and achieve a more thorough understanding of an idea.

## Quiz Yourself

Brainstorm potential questions you think might show up on the exam and practise answering them. Better yet, create a group chat with some of your peers so you can get questions you might not have even thought about preparing to answer.

## Host a Mock Test

If you are susceptible to blanking out in a test environment, mock tests can be super helpful. See if your classmates would be interested in taking an old practice test with you, and enlist a parent or older sibling to act as an invigilator to keep everyone quiet and within the time limits.

## Make Time to Socialise

If your plan is to spend every waking minute studying, you are not planning for success — you are planning for stress. Plan your time to create a balance between studying and socialising. Believe it or not, it will actually work in your favour when you go back to hit the books refreshed and energised.

## Focus

The biggest tip for succeeding this finals season may seem simple, but it is the most difficult thing to do. The promise of summer looms large, and that is enough to cloud anyone's focus. So, even if your friends are finishing their exams earlier than you, fight to keep your focus until your race is over too.
