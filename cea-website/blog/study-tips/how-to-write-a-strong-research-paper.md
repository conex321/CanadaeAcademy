# How to Write a Strong Research Paper

Research papers are a common assignment in many high school courses, particularly at the Grade 11 and 12 level. Whether you are writing for English, history, science, or social studies, a strong research paper demonstrates your ability to investigate a topic, evaluate sources, and present a clear argument. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you through the process.

## Step 1: Understand the Assignment

Before you begin, make sure you fully understand what is being asked. Pay attention to:

- The required length and format
- The topic or range of topics you may choose from
- The number and types of sources required
- The citation style (MLA, APA, Chicago, etc.)
- The due date and any intermediate deadlines

If anything is unclear, ask your teacher for clarification before you start.

## Step 2: Choose a Focused Topic

A common mistake is choosing a topic that is too broad. "Climate change" is a subject; "the impact of rising sea levels on coastal communities in Atlantic Canada" is a topic. The more focused your topic, the easier it will be to research and write about in a coherent way.

Ask yourself:

- Is this topic specific enough to cover thoroughly within the required length?
- Am I genuinely interested in this topic?
- Are there enough credible sources available?

## Step 3: Conduct Your Research

Use a variety of credible sources, including:

- Academic journals and databases
- Books and textbooks
- Government and institutional websites
- Reputable news outlets

As you research, take organised notes. Record the author, title, publication date, and page numbers for each source so you can create citations later.

## Step 4: Develop a Thesis Statement

Your thesis statement is the central argument of your paper. It should be specific, debatable, and supported by evidence. A strong thesis answers the question your research paper is exploring.

**Weak:** "Social media affects teenagers."
**Strong:** "Excessive social media use is linked to increased rates of anxiety and depression among Canadian teenagers aged 13 to 17."

## Step 5: Create an Outline

An outline provides structure for your paper and ensures your argument flows logically. A basic outline includes:

- **Introduction:** Hook, background information, thesis statement
- **Body paragraphs:** Each paragraph covers one main point, supported by evidence
- **Conclusion:** Summary of key points, restatement of thesis, final thoughts

## Step 6: Write Your First Draft

Do not aim for perfection on your first draft. Focus on getting your ideas down in a logical order. You can refine your language and polish your arguments during the revision stage.

Tips for your first draft:

- Start each body paragraph with a clear topic sentence
- Use evidence from your research to support each point
- Explain how the evidence connects to your thesis
- Use transitions between paragraphs to maintain flow

## Step 7: Revise and Edit

Revision is where good writing becomes great writing. Read through your paper with fresh eyes and ask yourself:

- Does my argument make sense from start to finish?
- Is each paragraph focused on a single idea?
- Have I supported my claims with evidence?
- Are my citations formatted correctly?
- Is my writing clear, concise, and free of errors?

Consider asking a friend, family member, or teacher to review your paper before you submit it.

## Step 8: Finalise Your Citations

Make sure every source you referenced in your paper is properly cited, both in-text and in your bibliography or works cited page. Incorrect or missing citations can result in academic integrity issues.

## You Can Do This

Writing a research paper is a skill that improves with practice. Each paper you write builds your ability to think critically, communicate clearly, and engage with complex ideas -- skills that will serve you well in post-secondary education and beyond.
