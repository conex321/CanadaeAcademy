# Websites That Can Improve Your English Essays

Your essays never seem to impress your English teacher. The pages are always marked in red pen, and your total grade is low. You want to change that, but you are not sure how. Start by looking into these online resources. They are bound to help you improve your English essays from this point forward.

## SparkNotes

[SparkNotes](https://www.sparknotes.com/) is one of the best online resources for English coursework. It offers literary study guides for books that will undoubtedly be on your class syllabus for the year.

Most notably, SparkNotes has comprehensive study guides for William Shakespeare's plays, including Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, A Midsummer Night's Dream, King Lear, Macbeth, and Julius Caesar. If you are having a hard time interpreting the language, the website offers a glossary of common Shakespearean terms and side-by-side translations.

## Your Local Library

Did you need secondary resources for your English essay? Your local library's website can help. For instance, the [Toronto Public Library's website](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/books-video-music/downloads-ebooks/) offers digital access to ebooks, audiobooks, magazines, and comics for members with a library card or account. They also offer video streaming services, so you can access documentaries and relevant films. Check with your own local library for similar digital resources.

## Merriam-Webster

If you do not have a dusty dictionary sitting on your shelf, do not worry -- you can go to the [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/) website to find definitions for tricky words. The website has a dictionary feature, a thesaurus feature, and a variety of useful articles on grammar and usage (like when to use an em dash or when to say "everyday" versus "every day").

## Grammarly

Another spelling and grammar resource that you can use to improve your essays is [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/). Grammarly will check your writing for grammar and spelling mistakes. It will suggest changes to the style and tone to make your final draft as strong as possible.

Grammarly's essay checker also comes with a plagiarism-checking feature. Students can use this feature to avoid unintentionally committing academic dishonesty. Even in high school, plagiarism is a serious accusation that could lead to a failing grade, suspension, and lost academic opportunities.

Finally, the Grammarly website has a blog filled with helpful posts for students trying to hone their essay skills. Read through them to learn how to write stronger paragraphs, how to make proper citations, or how to paraphrase an idea without plagiarising it.

## Online Course Upgrades

You do not have to settle for the marks you got on your previous English essays. With [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com), you can enrol in an upgrade credit course and get a second chance to boost your grade. This option is available for Grade 11 and 12 courses.

So, if you are unhappy with your marks from [ENG3U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng3u), [ENG4C](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng4c), or [ENG4U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng4u), you can enrol and take the course again. Doing this will help you sharpen your essay writing skills and gain confidence in the subject. If you do well, you could boost your grade for the course and bring up your overall average.

Use these online resources to your advantage. Your English essays will get better in no time.
