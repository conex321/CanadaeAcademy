# The Importance of Academic Integrity

One of the advantages of virtual learning is that you can have control of your education. But that also means you have an added responsibility to be fair, be honest, and take command of your learning by doing the work yourself. Some students may try to take the easy way through school, which involves copying, plagiarising, and cheating; and while it may make things easier in the short term, it certainly makes things more challenging in the long run.

## What Is Academic Integrity?

Academic integrity is your commitment to remain honest and fair throughout your time at school. [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com), like other schools, has a strict academic integrity policy which does not allow cheating or dishonest work. You are reminded that you must complete the work on your own and properly cite any sources you use for research. You must also follow the rules for test-taking closely. But what exactly is considered dishonest work?

## Plagiarism

Plagiarism is taking someone's work and trying to pass it off as your own. Examples of this could be using sources from online or in books but not giving them proper credit, copying your answers from a friend, or using AI to generate responses. Many assignments, such as writing an essay for [Grade 12 English (ENG4U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng4u), will allow you to use outside sources to support your ideas; however, it is imperative that you are paraphrasing (or using quotation marks on direct quotes) and citing your sources using APA, MLA, or Chicago formatting, depending on your teacher's preferences. This way, proper credit is given to those who deserve it, and your teachers know which sources were used for research.

## Cheating on Tests

Many courses at Canada e Academy require unit tests, such as [Grade 12 Biology (SBI4U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sbi4u). Tests (with the exception of final exams) are not supervised and rely on you to be honest. Unless otherwise specified, tests are strictly closed-book. This means you are not allowed to refer to the lessons, textbook, or your notes during tests. Additionally, you are not allowed to use Google to look up answers or AI to generate responses.

## How Does Canada e Academy Prevent Academic Dishonesty?

There are many steps that teachers at Canada e Academy take to prevent plagiarism and cheating from going unnoticed:

- Software to check for plagiarism and AI-generated content
- Ensuring students are citing their sources
- Noting if the work does not sound like that student's usual standard (sudden drastic improvement, language far above grade level, two students with similar answers)
- Not accepting late tests
- Requiring a proctor for the final exam

## What Happens if a Student Is Dishonest?

In the unfortunate situation where a student is dishonest, there are a number of immediate and long-term consequences. Questions that were plagiarised on tests will lose marks, and the entire test or assignment may receive a zero. The student will be given a strict warning the first time, and there will be parental involvement if the student is under 18. There will also be a note on the student's file.

However, the most significant impact will be your lack of learning. If you are cheating throughout the course, you will not retain the content, which could severely impact your future courses, especially if you continue your studies in college or university. Many universities have academic integrity policies posted on their websites. Cheating and plagiarism are taken very seriously in post-secondary school, and if the behaviour continues from high school, you may face suspension or expulsion.

## Conclusion

The takeaway is that cheating may seem like a shortcut, but in the long term it causes more hardship than it helped to alleviate. One of the challenges of online high school is remembering to be fair and honest with all the work you submit. Success takes dedication and hard work.
