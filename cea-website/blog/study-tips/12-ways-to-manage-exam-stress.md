# 12 Ways to Manage Your Exam Stress

There is no denying that exam season is a stressful time. Now more than ever, it is crucial to remember that while they are important, exams are not everything. What is more, they do not determine your worth as a person.

Of course, some anxiety surrounding exams is normal, and to a certain degree it can actually help sharpen your concentration. But when anxiety starts to impede your ability to perform as you otherwise would, it may be time to seek help from your instructor or guidance counsellor. In the meantime, here are some useful tips to help you manage your stress levels.

## Pre-Exam Studying

**1. Take care of your body.** Anxiety symptoms can only be worsened by drastically switching up your eating and sleeping routines right before an exam. Make the effort to be good to your body and your mind will be good to you. Physical activity is also a great way to relieve stress: go for a walk or a quick run and feel your shoulders loosen and your focus sharpen when you get back to it.

**2. Work through difficult concepts.** It may be anxiety-inducing to read through something you feel you know nothing about with the exam fast approaching, but think how much worse it would be to read that question on the exam and have no knowledge to answer it. Even a general understanding of a difficult concept can be enough to earn you some key points on an exam.

**3. Reach out.** Students tend to isolate themselves around exam time. While that may help you keep focused, isolation can actually increase your stress. Try talking through your anxieties with friends, family, or school staff. Emotional support can make all the difference in navigating stressful situations, so make sure you leave the door open to receiving it.

## The Day of the Exam

**4. Give yourself a break from studying** in the hours leading up to the exam itself. Make sure you eat a solid meal beforehand and pack some snacks to keep your brain fuelled if it is a lengthy exam. Check the batteries in your calculator and the ink in your pens to be 100% logistically prepared.

**5. Arrive early but steer clear of frantic students.** Surround yourself with students who are outwardly calm in the time leading up to your exam. If it feels like everyone is panicking, remember it is completely acceptable to find a quiet spot and skim through your notes in solitude before heading in.

**6. Think positive.** If you do not feel optimistic enough to tell yourself you are going to do great, at least be positive enough to stop thinking negatively. Instead of "I am going to fail," remind yourself "I have studied as much as I could with the time I had. I know what I know and it will be enough." Negative thinking will only serve to limit your self-perception and can actually impair your performance.

## During the Exam

**7. Scan through the whole exam** as soon as you get it so you know what you are dealing with. This can give your brain time to process answers to more complex questions as you tackle the easier ones, boosting your confidence as you go.

**8. Work smart.** Take a glimpse at the marking scheme and plan your time accordingly. The goal should always be to answer every question to the best of your abilities within the time allotted. If you find yourself spending too long on any single question, circle it to come back to later and move on.

**9. Stay focused on the process** of answering the question rather than on the end result. If your mind starts to drift or you find yourself catastrophising, take a thirty-second break. Close your eyes, take a couple of deep breaths, stretch, and refocus yourself on the task at hand.

## The Post-Exam Wait

**10. Do not overthink.** Reflection is good, and if there is some exam strategy to be learned from the experience, by all means use it for the next one. But beating yourself up for mistakes will only make your outlook worse.

**11. Study for the next exam** rather than re-studying for the one you already took. There truly is no point in going through lesson notes to figure out what the answer to a specific question was. Use your time wisely and look forward.

**12. Be confident, but realistic.** What is done is done. There is nothing you can change, so be kind to yourself and be confident in the answers you gave. Remember that your teachers are not out to see you fail, and if they can see that your train of thought was on the right track, chances are they will give you at least partial credit.
