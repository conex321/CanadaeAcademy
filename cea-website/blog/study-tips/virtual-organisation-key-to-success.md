# Virtual Organisation Is the Key to Success

While there are many habits and skills that contribute to academic success in high school, there is a great deal of research to suggest that organisation is a key component to optimal productivity and achievement. Depending on the type of course being studied and how it is delivered, organisation might look a little different in each case.

## Why Organisation Matters for Online Learners

Students who enrol in courses at [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com) experience the benefit of completing entire courses online from the comfort of their own homes. Whether you learn and complete assignments from the couch in the living room, a table in the kitchen, or a desk in a bedroom, the common denominator is the use of an electronic device such as a computer, laptop, or tablet.

Just like a physical desk, when these devices become cluttered and disorganised, it becomes more challenging and stressful to get work done quickly and efficiently. It becomes difficult to locate files, know what to do next, and access important tools for productivity.

## How to Keep Your Virtual Desktop Organised

Here are some practical suggestions for keeping your digital workspace tidy and efficient:

- **Back up important files** and sort through what you need versus what you can delete
- **Create folders** for documents you want to keep, organised by course or subject
- **Adopt a consistent file-naming system** to locate documents easily
- **Uninstall programs you no longer use** to free up space and reduce distractions
- **Use cloud storage** to keep files accessible without cluttering your computer
- **Prioritise regular maintenance tasks** like software updates and cleaning the hardware itself
- **Change your desktop background** to a calming landscape or colour palette

## Benefits of Virtual Desktop Organisation

Research suggests that a clean and organised desk creates a sense of order and control, reduces stress and anxiety, enhances focus, and improves overall work performance. Whether you are taking just a couple of courses, such as [ENG4U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng4u) online or [SBI4U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sbi4u) online, or completing your entire [Ontario Secondary School Diploma](https://canadaeacademy.com/ossd-requirements) online, organisation is the key to online success. It supports time management and helps you avoid procrastination in your online classes.
