# Master the Art of Essay Writing: 5 Tips to Boost Your Skills

For some students, the word "essay" brings to mind the most feared and hated form of schoolwork. [Essay anxiety](https://journal.uniku.ac.id/index.php/ERJEE/article/view/8559) is very common, and it is easy to understand why students may be apprehensive about writing one. It is a particular style of writing often reserved for school assignments, and the pressure to perform well can be daunting. However, essays do not need to be such a terrifying challenge. By keeping a few easy tips in mind, students can better understand why essays are helpful, enhance their essay-writing skills, and soon come to find essays are not as scary as they seem.

## Preparation Is Key

Before you begin writing, it is important to understand your topic. Taking notes early on can be very helpful. If you are writing a book report, you should make sure you are familiar with the book. Note any interesting quotes or ideas while reading, and do not forget to [properly cite your source](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_formatting_and_style_guide.html). If you are writing a research paper, make sure your research is complete before you begin writing your essay. Your essay is just about effectively communicating what you have learned from your research. Even if you are writing a personal essay that does not require outside sources, making notes of your own thoughts can be very helpful, so you know exactly what ideas you want to express. Ultimately, an essay is about communicating your thoughts clearly, so take time to understand them first.

## Understand the Purpose of an Essay

One reason students may suffer essay anxiety is that they may not fully understand the requirements for their assignment. The main goal of an essay is to prove a point, also known as a "thesis." Depending on the type of essay, how you prove the point may differ, but keeping in mind that you are writing to prove one central point can help you stay focused and give your ideas a connection and flow.

In a book report, for example, you may be trying to prove your personal interpretation of the book. In a research paper, your goal is to prove to your readers the conclusion that you have reached after doing your research. Even in a personal narrative essay, your goal would still be to express a core idea through your narrative.

## Embrace Structure

By the time students reach high school, many will have already been introduced to some standard forms of essay structure. It is important to remember that these exist largely to make your writing process easier. The common five-paragraph structure, for example, encourages writers to create a brief outline of their essay in the first paragraph. This introductory paragraph outlines the main point of your essay and serves as a blueprint for the rest of the paper. The body paragraphs then expand on the ideas introduced in the first paragraph. Once you have your introduction, the rest of the essay becomes more manageable because you already know what to write about in each section.

## Ask for Feedback

Almost no professional writing is published without first being reviewed or revised by editors. Your teachers are always willing to help with advice or feedback, so do not hesitate to ask for guidance. Whether you are unsure if your thesis is clear enough or you need help with structure, [your teachers](https://canadaeacademy.com/about) are there to help.

It is not just your teachers that you can ask for help and support. Friends, family, or classmates can often offer valuable insight and help. You might not always agree with their opinions, but since your goal is to express your thoughts, seeing how other people understand your writing is always useful.

## Always Proofread

An easy but often overlooked step in writing is to proofread your own work before having anyone else read it. Everybody makes mistakes and typos, but all writers should strive to find these mistakes before anyone else does. In school, simple mistakes can negatively impact your grades, so taking the time to proofread your work can significantly improve your marks.

You may find that reading your work out loud (even if quietly) can help you catch mistakes you might have missed. If it does not sound right out loud, then it probably is not right on paper. Also, remember to proofread again after making any changes.

## Conclusion: Essays Are Not Just for Schoolwork

Essays are not just an academic task -- they are a way to express ideas clearly and thoroughly. By following these tips, you will find that your essay-writing skills will improve in no time, and you will continue to grow as a writer with each new assignment.
