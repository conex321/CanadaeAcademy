# How to Write a Lab Report

If you are new to taking senior science classes, like [SCH4U (Grade 12 Chemistry)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sch4u), [SBI4U (Grade 12 Biology)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sbi4u), or [SPH4U (Grade 12 Physics)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sph4u), you may not be familiar with how to write a lab report. Classes like Grade 12 Biology require lab reports for each unit, so it is important that you know what to include and what to leave out.

## Title Page

To start, your lab report should have a title page with an informative title, your name, the course code, your teacher's name, and the date. It may also be helpful to include the unit number for the course.

**Coming up with a title:** It can be challenging to come up with a good title for assignments, and many students resort to simply calling it "Unit 3 Lab" or "Plant Lab." These titles are not the most effective because they do not tell the reader what the lab is about or what is being tested. A good example of a title would be "The Effects of Sunlight on the Transpiration Rates of Dieffenbachia Plants." This works well because it tells the reader what is being measured (the transpiration rates), what variable is being manipulated (the amount of sunlight), and which species is being tested (Dieffenbachia plant).

## Introduction

The introduction is where you should let your readers know what the lab report is about. Your introduction should include:

- Any background knowledge or research that may be important
- Key concepts and important terminology
- What the purpose of the experiment is
- Your thesis statement
- You may also make predictions and explain why you expected to see certain results

## Methods and Materials

The methods and materials section (also sometimes called "procedures") is where you will explain to your reader what you did and how you did it. It is important to be very precise, giving exact measurements, equipment, and methods in order for other people to potentially recreate the experiment in the future. Some examples of things to include are:

- Measurements of liquids
- Observation times
- Temperature of the environment
- Dates and times of observations
- Equipment used (microscope, centrifuge, petri dishes, etc.)
- Organisms (species, sex, number, etc.)
- Any formulae used in calculations
- Control groups

## Results

The results section is where you share the data you collected and the observations you made. This is where you will provide any tables or graphs, and you must be specific in what you observed. The data should be well organised and easy to read (such as in charts or graphs), and then you can go into more detail about what you observed in writing.

## Discussion

The discussion is usually the longest section of the lab report. This is where you analyse your results in detail and relate them back to your thesis statement. You may want to discuss any variables that may have impacted the results and any sources of error. This is where literature and other research can support your findings and offer some kind of explanation. Draw a conclusion and confirm if it supports your thesis, does not support your thesis statement, or if it is inconclusive.

## Conclusion

In this section, you summarise your study, relate it back to your thesis statement, and discuss any gaps in the research. You may also relate it to similar studies and compare whether your findings agree or disagree with those studies.

## References

The references section is very important because you need to give credit to any literature you referenced in your lab report. You should use the preferred style of your institution, which may be either APA, MLA, or Chicago. If you are not sure how to format your citations or reference list, [OWL Purdue](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/) is an excellent resource.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do all lab reports have to be written in this format?**
No, it depends on the grade, the class, and the teacher. Some are more informal -- formatted like questions and answers -- while others can be more extensive. If you are unsure of how to format your lab report, ask your teacher.

**Where should I include charts and tables?**
Charts and tables are generally placed in the results section because this is the data you collected from your experiment. If you have a lot of data, it can be helpful to select the most important charts and tables and place the rest in an appendix section at the end of the report.

**How do I formulate a thesis statement?**
A thesis is essentially an answer to your research question. It should be clear, concise, and state your position on the subject. For example, if your question is "Does sunlight increase or decrease the transpiration rate in Dieffenbachia plants?" a good thesis statement would tell the reader what the researcher believes to be true. A suitable thesis statement might be "As sunlight exposure to Dieffenbachia plants increases, the transpiration rate also increases." The results will then clearly either support or not support this statement.
