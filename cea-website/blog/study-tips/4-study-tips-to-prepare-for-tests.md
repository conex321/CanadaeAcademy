# 4 Study Tips to Help You Prepare for Tests

Writing tests can be anxiety-inducing for many students. In fact, it can be hard to even begin the process of preparing for a test when you are overwhelmed with how to begin. In this blog we will look at four simple tips to help you get ready for your upcoming test.

## 1. Get Organised

The first step in any good study plan is getting yourself organised. Whether you take your notes by hand, on an app, or on a computer, keeping your notes together and organised can be tough. But in order to study effectively, you will need to make sure you do not have to go digging around or searching for notes in the middle of a study session.

The best way to do this is to organise everything by unit. Map out each unit you need to study for a particular test or exam and then locate all the notes you have for that unit. Once you have them all in one place, you can go through them to see what you are working with. It is possible you may need to go back to the textbook to fill in some gaps.

One of the great things about taking courses with an online high school like [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/) is that you can actually go back through your lessons and re-watch them and even take screenshots of the presentation.

Now that your notes are all in one place, you will want to rewrite them in a more clear and concise manner. By rewriting your notes, it can help you make them easy to follow, and as an added bonus, writing your notes out by hand can actually help with [memory retention](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/03/210319080820.htm).

## 2. Find Your Study Environment

Everyone learns in their own way, and studying in an environment that is both comfortable and helps you focus is essential. Some students work best in quiet environments with a desk and absolutely no distractions. Others might do better in a comfortable chair, listening to music, with periodic breaks to help keep them on track.

It can take some trial and error before you are able to find the environment that works best for your needs. Once you have found the perfect study space, make sure you stay consistent in carving that area out as your designated study spot.

## 3. Make a Study Schedule

Once you have your notes and your study space ready to go, the next step is finding the time. Students have busy schedules -- between classes, part-time jobs, and extracurriculars, it can be hard to find the time to study.

Figure out where there is space in your schedule and set time aside. You may think it will be easy to just squeeze in some study time randomly when you find you have a spare moment, but this does not always work. By setting aside a designated time, you can ensure that you will be able to study in an effective manner.

If you are attending a virtual high school like Canada e Academy, sometimes it can be hard to build a schedule that works for you. If you are struggling to manage your time and need some help, Canada e Academy has a [Student Success](https://canadaeacademy.com/guidance) team that can help you make a study plan.

## 4. Practice Tests

At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/about), we want to make sure all of our students succeed in their courses. That is why we have included practice tests in the resources panel for our students. These practice tests, and even practice exams, are older versions of the current tests and exams in your course.

You can download these practice tests at any time and they have answer keys so that you can check your work. What is more, though they do not count for grades, you can send your practice test to your teacher for help. If there are questions you got wrong or things you did not understand, you can go over all of that with your teacher and get feedback to help you improve.

Courses in Math ([MHF4U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mhf4u), [MCV4U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mcv4u), [MDM4U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mdm4u)) and Science ([SCH4U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sch4u), [SBI4U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sbi4u), [SPH4U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sph4u)) are predominantly test-based, so being prepared for them by taking advantage of the practice tests will help to ensure you get the grade you want.

These four tips will help you to effectively study for your next test or exam. With Canada e Academy, we make it easy for students to get the most out of their education.
