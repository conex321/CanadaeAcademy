# Digital Tools That Can Boost Your Grades

As an online student, technology is already a central part of your learning experience. But beyond the courses themselves, there is a whole world of digital tools and apps that can help you stay organised, study more effectively, and ultimately boost your grades. Here are some of the best tools available to students today.

## Organisation and Productivity

### Notion or Google Keep

Staying on top of assignments, deadlines, and study notes is essential. Tools like Notion and Google Keep allow you to create digital notebooks, to-do lists, and calendars that keep everything in one place. You can colour-code by subject, set reminders for upcoming deadlines, and access your notes from any device.

### Google Calendar

Scheduling dedicated study time is one of the most effective ways to stay on track. Google Calendar lets you block out study sessions, set recurring reminders, and share your schedule with family members so they know when you need quiet time to focus.

### Trello

If you are a visual planner, Trello's board-and-card system is excellent for tracking assignment progress. Create boards for each course, add cards for each assignment, and move them through columns like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed."

## Study and Review

### Quizlet

Flashcards remain one of the most effective study tools, and Quizlet takes them digital. You can create your own flashcard sets or use ones created by other students. The app also offers games and practice tests to help reinforce your learning.

### Khan Academy

If you are struggling with a particular concept in math or science, Khan Academy offers free video lessons and practice exercises on a wide range of topics. It is an excellent supplement to your [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/) coursework.

### Grammarly

For courses that require writing, Grammarly is an invaluable tool. It catches spelling and grammar mistakes in real time and offers suggestions for improving your writing style. This can be especially helpful when working on essays, discussion posts, or lab reports.

## Focus and Well-Being

### Forest

Staying focused while studying on a computer can be challenging. Forest is an app that encourages you to put down your phone by growing a virtual tree during your study sessions. If you pick up your phone before your timer ends, the tree dies. It is a simple but effective way to build discipline.

### Calm or Headspace

Managing stress is just as important as managing your time. Meditation apps like Calm and Headspace offer guided sessions that can help you relax before a test or unwind after a long study session.

## Research and Citation

### EasyBib or Citation Machine

Properly citing your sources is essential for academic integrity. Tools like EasyBib and Citation Machine make it easy to generate citations in MLA, APA, and other formats. Simply enter the details of your source and the tool will format the citation for you.

### Google Scholar

When researching for essays or projects, Google Scholar is a powerful tool for finding credible academic sources. It indexes scholarly articles, theses, and books from a variety of disciplines.

## Making Technology Work for You

The key to using digital tools effectively is to find the ones that work best for your learning style and stick with them. You do not need to use every tool on this list -- even one or two can make a significant difference in your organisation and productivity.

At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/), we encourage students to take advantage of every resource available to them. The more effectively you use the tools at your disposal, the more successful you will be in your courses and beyond.
