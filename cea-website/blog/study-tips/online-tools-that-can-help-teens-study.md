# Online Tools That Can Help Teens Study

The internet is full of distractions, but it is also full of incredible resources that can help students study more effectively. If you know where to look, you can find free tools that make learning easier, more engaging, and more efficient. Here are some of the best online resources for high school students.

## For Math

- **Desmos (desmos.com):** A free online graphing calculator that is perfect for courses like [MHF4U Advanced Functions](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mhf4u) and [MCV4U Calculus and Vectors](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mcv4u). You can plot functions, create tables, and explore transformations visually.
- **Wolfram Alpha (wolframalpha.com):** A computational knowledge engine that can solve equations, show step-by-step solutions, and provide explanations for a wide range of math topics.
- **Khan Academy (khanacademy.org):** Offers comprehensive video lessons and practice problems for math at every level, from basic algebra to calculus.

## For Science

- **PhET Interactive Simulations (phet.colorado.edu):** Developed by the University of Colorado, these free simulations cover topics in physics, chemistry, biology, and earth science. They are an excellent way to visualise concepts that can be difficult to understand from text alone.
- **Crash Course (YouTube):** This popular YouTube channel offers engaging, fast-paced video lessons on topics including biology, chemistry, and physics.

## For English and the Humanities

- **Purdue OWL (owl.purdue.edu):** The Online Writing Lab at Purdue University is the go-to resource for essay writing, citation formats (MLA, APA), and grammar rules.
- **SparkNotes (sparknotes.com):** While it should never replace reading the actual text, SparkNotes can be a helpful supplement for understanding themes, characters, and literary devices in the novels you study.
- **Thesaurus.com:** A simple but effective tool for expanding your vocabulary and finding the right word for your essays.

## For Organisation

- **Google Docs:** Perfect for collaborative projects and for keeping your notes accessible from any device.
- **Todoist:** A task management app that helps you create to-do lists, set deadlines, and track your progress.
- **myHomework Student Planner:** Designed specifically for students, this app helps you track assignments, classes, and upcoming tests.

## For Focus

- **Pomodoro Timer (tomato-timer.com):** Based on the Pomodoro Technique, this simple timer alternates between 25-minute work sessions and 5-minute breaks, helping you maintain focus without burning out.
- **Lo-fi study music playlists:** Available on YouTube and Spotify, these playlists provide background music that many students find helps them concentrate.

## Using These Tools Wisely

While these tools can be incredibly helpful, they work best when used as supplements to your regular coursework -- not as replacements. The most effective study strategy combines your course materials from [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/) with targeted use of external resources to fill in gaps and reinforce your understanding.

Remember, the goal is not to use every tool available, but to find the ones that work best for your learning style and stick with them consistently.
