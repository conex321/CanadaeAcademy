# Learning the Balance of AI Use

**AI could hinder or enhance your learning — it is your choice.**

Artificial Intelligence has become as common in our vocabulary as the internet. In our day-to-day lives, it is nearly unavoidable. Even for those who do not actively use it, AI-generated videos, tools, and media appear as regularly as non-AI-generated content. This rapid integration into society has made it challenging for students to decipher the ways in which it is appropriate to use AI or not.

Like most things in life, using AI requires balance. [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com) strives to equip students with skills to become lifelong learners and responsible digital citizens. Avoiding AI entirely is not realistic, nor is it wise. You are going to continually engage with a society that increasingly relies on this technology. Therefore, it is important to understand the appropriate use of AI in and outside of the classroom to ensure that you are using it responsibly and growing as a learner.

Below are four ways that you can use AI appropriately.

## 1. Create Practice Quizzes

The old saying still rings true: practice makes perfect. Canada e Academy course material is always the first place you should turn to for practice, as it is instructor-generated and accurately reflects course material. However, you can never have too many practice questions, and AI will never run out of question ideas.

**Tips for effective AI-generated practice quizzes:**

- **Prompt AI effectively by specifying the learning targets.** Our course material reflects the Ontario curriculum, which is why our students are well prepared for post-secondary. The learning targets at the beginning of each lesson should guide your prompts. For example, a student taking [Grade 12 Advanced Functions (MHF4U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mhf4u) may include in their prompt "to ensure I can determine the exact values of primary trigonometric ratios and reciprocal trigonometric ratios for special angles."
- **Specify the type of questions you want to be asked.** Variety in your learning is vital to expanding your knowledge. Request short answer, long answer, and multiple choice questions. Specifying the type of knowledge, including critical thinking versus factual recall, will ensure you are getting the most out of your practice.

## 2. Focus on the Process

Ask your tools "Why?" not "What?". Using AI should never be about the final product. That leads to plagiarising assignments. AI should instead be used as a tool in the process of learning. While completing course material, you can use AI tools to provide deeper explanations of course content. However, it is important that you ask your platform to provide external links from where it retrieved the information. This ensures that the information you are being given is credible (free of error, bias, and reliable).

You can also use AI to see how certain information is applied in real careers. For example, a student in [BOH4M (Grade 12 Business Leadership)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/boh4m) might ask AI about the practical application of the Myers-Briggs Personality Test in the workplace.

Remember that your questions should be directed towards your instructor first and foremost. Our Ontario College of Teachers certified instructors are passionate about their course material and will respond to emails within 24 hours. AI can be used when you are in a flow with your study block, and the information can be verified by your instructor afterwards.

## 3. Check Your Understanding

When you are engaged in your material, you naturally begin thinking about its application. Using AI to check your understanding is a great tool. These platforms may also lead you to more avenues of thought, which you can analyse and think about independently. AI can help expand on why your answer to a question was incorrect, laying out the steps that should have been taken to arrive at the correct response.

## 4. Test Your Knowledge of Safe Technology Use

Ignoring the rise of AI completely may lead to a misunderstanding of these platforms, as well as decreased confidence with them, which can lead to not recognising when material is AI-generated and could be unreliable. Interaction with AI tools allows you to practise your own critical thinking skills and to gain insight into how the platforms work. Using AI shows you that information provided from countless platforms could generate unreliable answers, as not all the platforms it draws from are reliable. Furthermore, AI learns from the user's input, which can lead to biases.

## Questions and Answers

**Q: Why is avoiding AI entirely not recommended for students?**
A: Because AI is increasingly used in society, and students need to learn how to use it responsibly rather than ignore it.

**Q: How can AI be used appropriately to support studying?**
A: You can use AI to create practice quizzes, check your understanding, and deepen explanations of course material.

**Q: What is one key strategy for creating effective AI-generated practice quizzes?**
A: Clearly specify the learning targets and the type of questions needed (e.g., multiple choice, short answer, critical thinking).

**Q: Why should there be an emphasis on the process rather than the final product when using AI?**
A: Because using AI for final answers can lead to plagiarism, while using it for explanations and reasoning supports real learning.

Building literacy around AI use has become imperative to creating students who are prepared to enter the community. [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com) opens conversations with students, informing them of the appropriate uses of AI to ensure they are receiving the best education possible. Our courses encourage critical thinking, not only surrounding curriculum, but in life skills that you will take with you beyond high school.
