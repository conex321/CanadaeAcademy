# 3 Tips to Help You Focus During Online Classes

Every student knows how easy it can be to become [distracted during class](https://www.learningliftoff.com/study-finds-school-distractions-affect-student-learning/). Whether it be talking to your classmates, doing unrelated activities on your smartphone, or even just falling into a daydream, we have all been there. Online classes share some of the same possible distractions as traditional schools, but also have their own new [possible pitfalls](https://writingctr.rutgers.edu/blog/164-online-learning-distractions-at-home), while avoiding some others. Many students and their families may be concerned with distractions during online classes; however, with a few tips, students may even find it easier to focus during online classes than during traditional school.

## 1. Find or Create an Ideal Study Location

While traditional classrooms are designed to be effective study locations, there can still be a number of possible distractions, such as talking to your friends. With online classes, this distraction is definitely still a possibility, but it can also be more easily sidestepped simply by putting your phone away. However, online study comes with its own set of distractions.

It would be easy enough to study from the comfort of your family living room; however, shared spaces can be hard to focus in, given that your family, or even pets, could easily distract you. Setting up to work in your bedroom would help negate distraction from others in your household, but you could be distracted by the temptation of all the personal things that may be around the room.

If you do choose to create your study space in the privacy of your bedroom, here are some tips:

- **Carve out a dedicated study area** in your bedroom and fill it with all the things you might need for your class. You can immerse yourself in an environment that helps you put your brain in "study mode."
- **Make sure to have a chair and desk** that are comfortable and functional. Having a comfortable and functional place to study is essential.
- **Put other distracting items out of your line of sight.** If you think you might be tempted by other things in your bedroom (such as a TV, video game console, or books), make sure to create a study area where those temptations are out of sight.

Another option is to go to a public location like a library or community centre. Sometimes this space can allow a student to get in a study mindset and remain focused. Noise-cancelling headphones can help if you find chatter or other sounds easily distracting.

There are many options when it comes to finding a study space, and what works for one student may not work for another -- but that is okay, because with online learning, you get to choose what works best for you.

## 2. Study at a Time That Works for You

If you take online classes from home, maybe there are times when your home is a bit busier, and you have other things that tempt you away from your lesson. That is okay! With asynchronous online learning, like that offered by [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/), you can take that time to do other things and reschedule your study time for when things are a bit quieter.

The time of day you choose to study can also have an impact on your ability to focus. Maybe you are not a morning person, and being tired leads you to daydreaming. Perhaps you find that you are better able to focus late at night or in the afternoon. With online, asynchronous courses, you can feel free to work at any time!

## 3. Take Advantage of the Unique Tools Available During Online Classes

Online classes come with their own unique tools that can help a student fight distraction. For example, at Canada e Academy, students are [able to pause, rewind, and replay lessons at any time](https://canadaeacademy.com/faq). Sometimes a distraction may be inevitable, but do not be afraid to admit to yourself that you were not paying full attention -- you can simply replay the relevant part of the lesson you missed.

You can also set timers for yourself for when and how long you want to focus on certain tasks. You can even schedule a time for you to set aside your work and relax, to indulge in distractions, so that you are rested and ready when it is time to return to class.

There are many different ways to counter distractions during online classes. With the additional options online classes give students, they can come up with whole new strategies that suit their own unique needs.
