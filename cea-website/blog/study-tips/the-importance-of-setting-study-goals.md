# The Importance of Setting Study Goals

For many students it can be easy to get sidetracked and procrastinate on homework. Sometimes you look at the amount of work you need to do and it seems like too much, or you get distracted by other activities you might rather be doing. This is why setting study goals for yourself can help. You can get work done and meet deadlines with less stress. Here are some helpful ways to set study goals for yourself.

## Setting Dates

The first step is writing down the date something is due. In regular day schools, students need to meet certain deadlines that are set out for them. They can easily write down this day and know exactly when to hand something in.

For students online, setting due dates can be a little more difficult. At Canada e Academy, our flexible platform allows students to set their own schedule and hand in assignments when they would like. While this offers many benefits -- allowing students to learn at their own pace and build their education around their schedule -- it can sometimes be easy to put off homework until the last possible minute. Leaving things to the very end can cause stress and anxiety, which is not helpful. That is why it is important to set goals and due dates for yourself.

Start by considering when you need or want to finish your course. With Canada e Academy you have up to one year from the time you enrol to complete the course; however, you may be trying to finish courses within your regular school year or get courses completed in time for university applications, or maybe you just have a specific day you want to finish up by. Whatever the reason, figure out which day you plan to finish your course and write it down.

You can use paper and pen calendars or, if you would prefer, there are [several apps](https://calendly.com/blog/6-best-planner-apps-for-students#todoist) that can help you keep track of dates and assist you with staying organised.

If you are struggling to make a study schedule on your own, you can reach out to our [Student Support](https://canadaeacademy.com/guidance) team, who can help you create a plan to keep you moving forward in your course.

## Breaking Down the Work

Sometimes when looking at assignments it is easy to feel overwhelmed -- they can seem like a lot of work and it can be hard to get started. That is why breaking things down into smaller, more manageable goals can help you meet deadlines with ease.

Start by reading through the entire assignment and think about ways you could break it down into smaller chunks. For example, let us say you have to write an essay. You can easily break this down into smaller pieces:

**Step 1: Choose a topic** -- Write down some ideas you like. Think about them for a little while and choose one you think you would want to write about.

**Step 2: Research** -- You have chosen your topic. Now you have to find some information about it. Search for information online, go to a local library, maybe even find some videos or documentaries about it. Take notes on the information you find and make sure to keep all your sources cited and clear.

**Step 3: Write the Introduction** -- Start with the introduction. Explain what you plan to talk about and list the items you will discuss specifically throughout the essay.

**Step 4: Write about each subtopic** -- You have a few specific points you would like to cover throughout the paper. Write down each point separately, no matter how much or how little information you have for the sections.

**Step 5: Edit** -- Go through each point you wrote. Edit your ideas and select the ones you want to keep. Then organise them into logical order and put them together with your introduction.

**Step 6: Write your conclusion** -- Write a conclusion to sum up the information you have discussed throughout and make your final points.

**Step 7: Edit Again** -- Go through everything you have written. Does it make sense? Does it flow? Is it easy to follow? Check for grammar and spelling.

**Step 8: Works Cited** -- Most essays will require you to make a works cited page. Go through everything in your essay and make sure you have properly cited your sources.

**Step 9: Double check and finish** -- Double check everything is exactly how you want it and submit your paper.

This is just an example of how you can break down one big assignment into several smaller pieces to make it more manageable.

## Preparing for Tests

Just like breaking down an assignment, you can organise how you prepare for a test. At Canada e Academy, for courses like Math ([MHF4U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mhf4u), [MCV4U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mcv4u)) and Science ([SBI4U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sbi4u), [SCH4U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sch4u), [SPH4U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sph4u)) among others, students are given access to practice tests to help prepare them. Take a look at the practice test and the topics covered, also go back through the lessons and make a list of all the topics you should know about.

Separate those topics into ones you think you know well and ones that you find you struggle to understand. Study your notes and review lessons for each topic, devoting more time to areas you find difficult. Set goals to help you study -- choose a set amount of time you can devote to studying each day, whether it is two hours or thirty minutes.

It can be hard for students to organise their time and stay on task, especially when they have a lot of freedom in how their course is structured. By setting goals, staying organised, and breaking down work into smaller tasks, students are able to keep on track and take control of their learning.
