# 6 Steps for Making an Effective Study Plan

Making an effective study plan can be a very useful tool for any student, but with the increased independence that comes with online learning, a study plan can be even more helpful. This is not only because more [independence means more personal responsibility](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347400735_Student_Learning_Independence_in_Online_Learning_Depends_on_Motivation), but because students can have more individualized study plans that suit their particular needs. But making these plans can be tricky, especially if you have never done it before. Here are six steps you can use to get started.

## 1. Think About Long-Term Plans

To make a plan, the first step is to find out what you need to do! You can start with long-term plans, which may be a bit more vague, then work your way down to more specific details. Some questions to ask yourself are:

- What are you hoping to do after graduation?
- When are you hoping to graduate?
- What is your desired career?

Many career pathways [require you to take certain courses in high school](https://www.ontariouniversitiesinfo.ca/glossary/prerequisites), so looking that far ahead can help you decide which courses you need to take. Many students find themselves graduating later than they had hoped because they did not realise they needed to take a particular high school course until they were already applying for post-secondary education programmes. By planning in advance, you can avoid issues like these.

## 2. Take an Overview

Once you have your classes planned out, it is time to plan how you are going to complete each class. Some questions to consider might be:

- How much time do you think you will need to dedicate to each class?
- What about your responsibilities outside of class?
- How much free time do you need for yourself?
- What timeframe is realistic when you consider all of the other things you need to do?

Keeping all your needs in balance can help you in both your academic and personal life.

## 3. Go Over Your Course Syllabus

Many classes will provide you with a syllabus when you begin -- a general overview of all of the major things you will be doing in the class. At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/), you can even view all the lessons and assignments before you begin. By looking at the different topics and assignments, you can get an idea of how much time and effort you may need to give to each one in order to do your best.

The [courses offered at Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses) allow you to take lessons and complete assignments whenever you like, and you can complete a course in as little as four weeks or take up to 12 months. This means if you want to focus on one class at a time, you can. Some students decide that instead of a traditional approach of taking four classes at once for a full semester, they would rather focus on one class at a time for a quarter of the semester each, fully immersing themselves in each one before moving on to the next.

## 4. Plan Each Individual Unit, Lesson, and Assignment

Your courses will be comprised of several units -- general topics that lessons fall under. While Canada e Academy allows you to complete lessons and assignments in any order you like, many classes feature lessons and assignments that build upon each other, and it might be a good idea to make a general unit plan for each portion of the course.

You can take tests whenever you like, but it is important to schedule a time for yourself when you know you will have a few hours of privacy and quiet, free of distractions and able to focus on your task.

## 5. Set Aside Time and a Place to Study

Once you know what you need to do, it is time to figure out where and when you can do it. You may find it helpful to set small goals for yourself -- to complete a certain number of lessons or assignments per week, to read a certain number of pages from a novel or textbook every day. Maybe you set aside a particular time every day (or night) to work on your classes. You may also find it useful to set aside a study area. Planning could involve making your room, or even just your desk, the perfect environment for you to use as a study space.

## 6. Adjust Plans When Needed

Sometimes the best-laid plans can still go awry. Even with careful planning, things will not always go as expected. That does not mean that all your planning was wasted, however. Usually, you will find only a small adjustment is really needed, and the rest of your plans can still be useful. A study plan is a tool to help you, and if parts of it are not helping you, then change them!

These are just a few tips to get you started. Please check out our [Student Success](https://canadaeacademy.com/guidance) page for more information on creating a study plan.
