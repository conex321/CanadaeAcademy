# 7 Easy Steps to Help You Prepare for Exams

As the holiday season comes to an end and classes resume, students are heading into exam season. You have to worry about studying on top of finishing other coursework, participating in extracurriculars, and for seniors, submitting post-secondary applications. With so much going on, it is not surprising that you might struggle to keep up and find yourself stressed out. If you are worried about getting ready for exams, here are seven helpful steps to help you prepare.

## 1. Get Information on the Exam Format

The first step to getting ready for any exam is to understand what to expect. Will it be multiple choice? Fill in the blank? Long or short answer questions? Ask your teacher about the format or see if you can access older versions of exams so you can get a feel for what the actual exam will look like. Not only will this help with your studying, but knowing what your test will look like can help ease some anxiety about it.

## 2. Develop a Study Plan

Thinking about where to start studying can be a bit overwhelming, not to mention finding the time in your schedule. To help make this easier, break down your tasks into smaller parts. First, figure out the major topics you will need to prepare for your exam. Do not worry too much about the subtopics; focus on the big picture headings.

Once you have your topics, create a study schedule. Whether you prefer pen and paper or an electronic calendar, it is important to physically create a schedule to keep track of your study plans. Sticking to a dedicated schedule can help ensure that you always make the time you need to review your notes.

## 3. Organise Your Notes

In order to help keep you on track with your study schedule, it is important to make sure your notes are organised. You do not want to waste time every study session trying to find notes or information. Go through all your notes and organise them by the subject topics you know you need to cover. It can also be beneficial to rewrite your notes, both for organisation and for memory retention.

## 4. Take Breaks

Make sure when you create your study schedule that you make time for breaks. Get up and move around or stop to have a quick snack while you are studying. If you try to study for too long without taking a break, it can be hard to remain focused and engaged. By taking short breaks throughout your study session, you can clear your head and help yourself to refocus with more energy when you return to your notes.

## 5. Practice with Old Exams

After spending some time studying, it can help you feel confident that you are as prepared as possible by taking a practice exam. At Canada e Academy, whether you are taking [Grade 12 English (ENG4U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng4u), [Grade 10 Math (MPM2D)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mpm2d), or [Grade 12 Chemistry (SCH4U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sch4u), all of our courses come with practice tests and exams that you can use to help you study. The practice exams are older versions of our current exams and come with answer keys. By taking a practice test the same way you would a real one, you can reduce your anxiety around the actual testing procedure and get an idea of whether you are on track to be successful.

## 6. Get a Good Night's Rest

Now that you have done your studying and completed your practice exam, it is important to get a good night's rest so you are fully recharged. Make sure that you do something other than study before you go to bed; otherwise, you may find that you are too anxious to sleep. Read a book, listen to some music, or do anything that will help get your mind off studying and your upcoming test.

## 7. Plan Out Your Exam Day

Last, but certainly not least, make sure you plan out the day of your exam ahead of time. Being as relaxed as possible going into an exam is important to achieving success. Here are some things you can do to plan your exam day:

- **Set an alarm.** Figure out what time you need to wake up in order to get ready and travel to your exam location.
- **Wear comfortable clothing.** There is nothing wrong with heading to an exam in sweatpants or an oversized sweater. Feeling comfortable can help keep you focused.
- **Eat a good breakfast.** There is nothing more distracting than a rumbling stomach. Eating a good meal will give you energy and keep you from getting distracted during your test.
- **Make travel plans.** If you need to travel somewhere to write your exam, make sure you know where you are going and how to get there.

Following these quick and easy steps can make sure you are ready for any test or exam. At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com), we are here to support you every step of the way.
