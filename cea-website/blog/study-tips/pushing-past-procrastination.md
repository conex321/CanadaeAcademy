# Pushing Past Procrastination

We have all procrastinated at one point or another. But for habitual procrastinators, this habit can wreak havoc on your mental well-being. Understanding the reasons behind your individual decision to procrastinate is the first step towards overcoming it.

As a concept, we understand procrastination. It is the "putting off until tomorrow" mentality that takes over when we believe that further along our current path is something we do not want to confront or do. What we need to do is determine the reason behind our individual decision to procrastinate.

For some, it is a fear of reaching the finish line. For others, it can be chalked up to a lack of motivation. Still others procrastinate as a result of self-doubt: they do not believe in their ability to complete the task at hand, or do not see themselves as worthy of doing it, believing it a task better suited to someone else.

Ultimately, whatever the reason, procrastination always results in the same thing. Task A remains unfinished. Typically, Task B will pile on top of Task A, and so on, until feelings of anxiety or panic set in and force your hand. But why wait for this negativity to spur you onwards? How can you take charge of your tendency to procrastinate and address it before it kicks in?

## Step 1: Understand Why You Procrastinate

The first step is to understand why you procrastinate. Some good old-fashioned self-reflection should accomplish this easily enough. Think about the last time you put something off. What were you feeling? What was it about the task that made you want to avoid it?

## Step 2: Create a Plan of Action

The next step is to take that reason (or reasons) and come up with a workable plan of action to resolve the root cause. For example, if you do not want to complete something (say, your high school diploma) for fear of what comes next, do some research and find a path that does not scare you and work forward from there. If the cause is self-doubt, reassure yourself that you can do this. And if you start and begin to struggle, know there is no shame in asking for help, even belatedly.

## Step 3: Shift Your Attitude

All too often, the easiest solution to procrastination comes down to a shift in attitude. Try to see the task, and completing it, from a different, more positive perspective and see what happens. Break large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. Celebrate small wins along the way.
