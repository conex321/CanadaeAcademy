# 5 Tips for Avoiding Senioritis

This is it. The stress of applying to schools and submitting midterms is over. You have chosen your path for the fall and you are ready for summer to just get here already. It is a time of relief and celebration — and it is also prime season for senioritis.

Senioritis is the mindset born out of boredom, relief, and anticipation that takes over towards the end of your high school career and encourages you to coast through the final weeks simply because you have your offer of admission in hand and graduation day circled on the calendar. The problem is that senioritis is not something that can just be turned on and off. The symptoms often carry over into other aspects of life and can pose serious attitude problems if not addressed by the time September comes around.

Whether you are just beginning to feel a few of the classic symptoms or you are self-diagnosing a full-blown case, here are a few tips to help you refocus and stay on the path to success.

## 1. Keep Your Head in the Game

You are less than two months away from graduating — the finish line is so close. While it can be tempting to spend all your time thinking about summer and freedom, it is more important than ever that you keep your head in the game. A lot can happen in the final quarter, and you do not want to let all the hard work you have put in slip while you laze around waiting for the final buzzer to sound. And remember: colleges and universities can change their minds if you let your grades slip too much, so do not put yourself in a position where this might become a concern.

**Bottom line:** Stay focused and work hard until that [OSSD](https://canadaeacademy.com/ossd-requirements) is in your hands.

## 2. Stay Challenged

Boredom is the nemesis of focus, and after years of sitting in a classroom, it is understandable why seniors catch the boredom plague. The best course of action when you feel your focus starting to stray is to seek out new ways to keep yourself challenged, both inside and outside the classroom. Whether this means volunteering to mentor younger peers, joining a new club or team, or picking up a part-time job, it is important to keep your days filled with meaningful activities that keep you feeling stimulated and productive.

**Bottom line:** Do not give in to boredom — find new ways to stimulate yourself.

## 3. Form Good Habits Early

In less than four months, you may be walking through the door of your first college or university class. Why wait until then to start mentally preparing yourself for success? While it may be tempting to skip classes in these final weeks, remember that in just a few short months you are going to be responsible for getting yourself to class and succeeding all on your own. If you start allowing yourself to skip out now because the classes "do not really matter," you are setting a pattern that will follow you into post-secondary.

**Bottom line:** Do not fall down the rabbit hole of skipping classes.

## 4. Get Organised

Do not let years of hard work and perseverance fall through in the last 12 weeks. Keep track of your coursework and keep those grades up. Remember that Grade 12 marks are the most important grades of your career thus far, and will be taken into consideration for admissions if you decide to change programs later on. Schedule an appointment to talk to your [guidance counsellor](https://canadaeacademy.com/guidance) to make sure everything is on track for final grade submissions. Your counsellors can also help you make sure you are staying within a safe range in terms of maintaining any conditional acceptances you may have received.

**Bottom line:** Make triple sure everything is in order — and stays in order — for graduation.

## 5. Enjoy Your Moment

Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, take this time to enjoy being a high school senior. All too often, seniors spend so much time looking forward at what is to come that they forget to embrace where they are now. The end of high school also means saying goodbye to the vast majority of the peers and teachers you have grown close to over the past four years, so make the most of the time you have together.

**Bottom line:** Embrace your time as top dog while it lasts, because in a few short months you will be starting fresh.
