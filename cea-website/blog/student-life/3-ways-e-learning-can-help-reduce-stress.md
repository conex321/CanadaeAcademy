# 3 Ways E-Learning Can Help Reduce Stress

It is a well-known fact that the pressure to earn top marks only gets stronger as students move through school, as the pursuit of post-secondary draws ever closer. In traditional school environments, there are added social stressors, such as bullying and cliques, on top of all the traditional stresses that come with being a teenager. It is an unfortunate reality that many students find high school to be a profoundly stressful experience.

At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com), we have received a great deal of feedback from alumni saying that their online learning experience with us has greatly reduced their stress about school. Here are a few ways how learning online with a flexible model can help you improve your mental health during your high school years.

## 1. Working from the Comfort of Your Own Home

One of the most readily apparent benefits of online learning is being able to study from anywhere, including the comfort of your own home. Being able to access lessons from home allows you to create your own personalised space, which can be designed to suit your particular learning needs and preferences. Or, if there is another environment you find more comfortable, you can work there instead. With online learning, the world is your classroom.

## 2. Avoiding Social Pressures

Unfortunately, many stressors within the high school experience have nothing to do with academic pressures at all. Instead, many students find the highly social environment to be the most stressful part. Studies have shown that even subtle forms of bullying can negatively impact a student's education. In some cases, students have felt undue stress stemming from interactions with peers.

Online learning sidesteps all of these issues. While students still have opportunities to communicate with classmates and teachers through email and online discussion forums, the engagement is asynchronous and, often, optional — meaning you can disengage whenever you like. This remote, pressure-free environment helps to minimise the social discomfort many shy or previously victimised students feel. In short, online learning allows you to socialise on your own terms.

## 3. Taking Control of Your Education

With online learning, you can take the reins of your own education. This allows you to foster greater confidence and self-awareness. When you are in charge, outside stressors are minimised. If you can customise your own education, you can personalise it in a way that works for you.

At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com), there are many examples of this highly customisable approach to education:

- Choose the courses you want to take from [a wide selection](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses), without concern over start dates, class capacities, or conflicting scheduling.
- Study whenever you like, for as long as you like, with whatever regularity suits you best.
- Learn at your preferred pace: you are free to pause, replay, or fast-track lessons as suits your needs.

For students looking for a more stress-free solution to education, consider exploring the many benefits a fully online school can offer. Visit [canadaeacademy.com](https://canadaeacademy.com) to learn more.
