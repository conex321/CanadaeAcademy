# Getting Your Community Service Hours

One of the requirements for earning your Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD) is the completion of 40 hours of community involvement. While this may seem like a lot, with some planning and creativity, you can fulfil this requirement while also gaining valuable experiences and skills.

## What Counts as Community Involvement?

Community involvement activities must be unpaid and completed outside of instructional hours. They should benefit the community and can include a wide range of activities such as:

- Volunteering at a local food bank, shelter, or community centre
- Helping at a library, hospital, or retirement home
- Assisting with community events, festivals, or clean-ups
- Coaching or mentoring younger students
- Volunteering with a religious or cultural organisation
- Participating in charity runs, walks, or fundraisers
- Tutoring peers in academic subjects

## Tips for Finding Opportunities

### Start Local

Check with your local community centre, library, place of worship, or municipality for volunteer opportunities. Many organisations are actively looking for volunteers and will be happy to accommodate your schedule.

### Use Online Resources

Websites like [Volunteer Canada](https://volunteer.ca/) and local volunteer match platforms can help you find opportunities in your area that match your interests and availability.

### Think About Your Interests

Volunteering is much more enjoyable when it aligns with your interests. If you love animals, consider volunteering at an animal shelter. If you are passionate about the environment, look for conservation or clean-up projects. If you enjoy working with children, consider coaching or mentoring.

### Plan Ahead

Do not wait until Grade 12 to start your community involvement hours. Beginning in Grade 9 gives you plenty of time to accumulate hours without feeling rushed. Even just a few hours per month can add up quickly.

## Tracking Your Hours

Keep careful records of your volunteer activities, including:

- The organisation you volunteered with
- The dates and times of your service
- A description of your activities
- The name and contact information of your supervisor

At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/), you can submit your completed community involvement hours through our administrative office. Make sure to have your hours signed off by the organisation you volunteered with.

## Beyond the Requirement

While the OSSD requires 40 hours, many students find that they enjoy volunteering and choose to do more. Community involvement looks great on post-secondary applications and resumes, helps you develop important skills, and makes a positive difference in your community.

If you have questions about the community involvement requirement, contact our [guidance team](https://canadaeacademy.com/guidance) for assistance.
