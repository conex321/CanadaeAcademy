# Celebrating Black Authors: Books to Add to Your Reading List

Reading widely is one of the best things you can do as a student -- it builds vocabulary, improves writing skills, develops empathy, and broadens your understanding of the world. One way to enrich your reading experience is to seek out diverse voices, including the incredible works of Black authors who have shaped and continue to shape literature.

Here is a curated list of books by Black authors that are perfect for high school students.

## Fiction

**"The Hate U Give" by Angie Thomas** -- A powerful young adult novel about a teenager who witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend by a police officer. It explores themes of race, identity, and justice in America.

**"Half of a Yellow Sun" by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie** -- Set during the Nigerian Civil War, this novel tells the story of three characters whose lives intersect during a pivotal moment in African history.

**"Children of Blood and Bone" by Tomi Adeyemi** -- A fantasy novel inspired by West African mythology that explores themes of power, oppression, and resilience.

**"The Underground Railroad" by Colson Whitehead** -- A Pulitzer Prize-winning novel that reimagines the Underground Railroad as an actual railroad beneath the soil, following a young woman's journey to freedom.

## Non-Fiction

**"Between the World and Me" by Ta-Nehisi Coates** -- Written as a letter to the author's son, this book explores the reality of being Black in America and the history of racial injustice.

**"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" by Maya Angelou** -- An autobiographical account of Angelou's early life, exploring themes of identity, racism, and the power of literature and language.

**"Becoming" by Michelle Obama** -- The former First Lady's memoir chronicles her journey from the South Side of Chicago to the White House, offering insights on perseverance, education, and public service.

## Poetry

**"Citizen: An American Lyric" by Claudia Rankine** -- A genre-defying work that uses poetry, essays, and images to explore everyday experiences of racism and belonging.

**"The Collected Poems of Langston Hughes"** -- Hughes is one of the most influential poets of the 20th century, and his work explores the African-American experience with beauty, depth, and power.

## Canadian Voices

**"Washington Black" by Esi Edugyan** -- A Canadian novel that follows a young enslaved boy who escapes a Barbados sugar plantation and embarks on a globe-spanning journey of discovery.

**"The Skin We're In" by Desmond Cole** -- A powerful non-fiction work examining anti-Black racism in Canada, challenging the notion that Canada is immune to systemic racism.

## Why Diverse Reading Matters

Reading books by authors from diverse backgrounds helps us understand perspectives different from our own. It builds empathy, challenges assumptions, and enriches our understanding of the world. For students studying English at [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/), reading widely is also excellent preparation for literary analysis and essay writing.

We encourage all students to explore these titles and discover the rich tapestry of Black literary voices.
