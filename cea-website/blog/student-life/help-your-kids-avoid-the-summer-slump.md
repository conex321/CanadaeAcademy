# Help Your Kids Avoid the Summer Slump

The "summer slump" -- also known as summer learning loss -- is a well-documented phenomenon where students lose some of the academic gains they made during the school year. Research suggests that students can lose up to two months of reading and math skills over the summer if they are not engaged in learning activities.

As a parent, there are several things you can do to help your children stay sharp over the break without turning their summer into an extension of the school year.

## Encourage Reading

Reading is one of the most effective ways to prevent summer learning loss. Encourage your child to read books that interest them -- it does not have to be academic material. Fiction, graphic novels, magazines, and non-fiction on topics they are passionate about all count. Visit your local library together and let them choose their own books.

## Make Learning Fun

Learning does not have to happen at a desk. Summer offers countless opportunities for informal learning:

- Cooking together teaches math (measuring, fractions) and science (chemical reactions)
- Nature hikes can spark interest in biology and environmental science
- Travel, even locally, provides opportunities for learning about history and geography
- Board games and puzzles develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills

## Consider Summer Courses

For students who want to get ahead or make up a credit, summer courses offer a productive use of the break. At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/), students can take courses throughout the summer at their own pace. This allows them to earn credits while still having plenty of time for summer activities.

Summer courses can also be a great way for students to lighten their course load for the upcoming school year, giving them more time for the subjects they find most challenging.

## Maintain Some Structure

While summer should be more relaxed than the school year, maintaining some basic structure can help prevent the complete abandonment of productive habits. Consider:

- Setting a consistent wake-up time (it can be later than during the school year)
- Dedicating a small amount of time each day to reading or learning
- Limiting screen time and encouraging outdoor activity
- Keeping a journal or blog about summer activities

## Stay Connected

Encourage your child to stay in touch with friends and participate in group activities. Social engagement supports emotional well-being, which in turn supports learning readiness.

## The Payoff

Students who stay engaged over the summer return to school more confident, more prepared, and less likely to struggle with the transition back to academic life. A little effort during the break can make a big difference when September arrives.
