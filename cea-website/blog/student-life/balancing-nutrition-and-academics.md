# Balancing Nutrition and Academics: A Guide for Students

As educators at Canada e Academy, we recognise the importance of teaching students how to effectively balance their nutritional goals while completing online OSSD credits. In [HFA4U, Nutrition and Health](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/hfa4u), once students learn about the significance of nutrition during adolescence and its pivotal role in long-term health, they are eager to follow nutritional guidelines highlighted in [Canada's Food Guide](https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/). However, the main barrier many students encounter is a lack of time. Here are a few strategies to stay on track without compromising your nutrition and health.

## Key Strategies for Balancing Nutrition and Academics

### 1. Meal Planning

- Use a calendar to plan out your meals for the week (this is also cost-effective, as you will find yourself only purchasing the required items)
- Dedicate a few hours every weekend to cook in batches and store pre-portioned meals
- Refer to the [Food Guide](https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/) to ensure each meal includes healthy carbohydrates, protein, fruits, and vegetables

### 2. Healthy Snacks

- Prepare healthy snacks in advance so you do not find yourself reaching for highly processed sugary snacks
- Examples: hummus and baby carrots, Greek yogourt parfait, protein banana bread, apple slices with nut butter, trail mix, whole grain crackers and cheese

### 3. Scheduled Meal Breaks

- Set a reminder for meal and snack breaks to maintain energy levels and focus for your online courses throughout the day
- Plan meals before or after your study sessions to avoid missing meals (completing high school credits online provides you with the flexibility to build your daily schedule according to your needs)

### 4. Hydration

- Keep a bottle of water in close proximity (aim for a larger bottle, such as one litre)
- Infuse your water with natural flavouring of your choice (such as lemon, lime, mint, or berries)

### 5. Mindful Eating

- Try to eat your meals away from the screen and with others
- Eat slowly and be aware of fullness cues

## Why It Matters

Balancing nutrition and academics does not have to be a chore. Having a nutrient-rich diet can actually positively impact your academic success, as it can help improve your energy, clarity, and memory retention. By following the time-saving tips above, you can take small steps to improving your long-term health while also building healthy habits.

We challenge you to eat healthy in a timely and cost-effective way, all while completing your high school courses online.
