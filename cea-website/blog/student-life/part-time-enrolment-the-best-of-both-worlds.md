# Part-Time Enrolment: The Best of Both Worlds

Not every student needs to attend online school full-time. In fact, one of the most popular ways students use [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/) is through part-time enrolment -- taking one or two courses online while continuing their studies at a traditional day school.

## Why Choose Part-Time Enrolment?

### Timetable Conflicts

One of the most common reasons students turn to online learning is to resolve timetable conflicts at their day school. When two courses you need are offered at the same time, taking one online is the perfect solution.

### Course Availability

Not every school offers every course. If your day school does not offer a course you need -- whether it is a specific prerequisite, an elective, or a French Immersion course -- you can take it online through Canada e Academy.

### Getting Ahead

Part-time online enrolment is a great way to get ahead on credits. By taking an additional course online, you can lighten your future course load or even work toward early graduation.

### Upgrading a Mark

If you have already completed a course but your mark is not as high as you would like -- perhaps you need a higher grade for post-secondary admission -- you can retake the course online through our [upgrade programme](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/upgrade-courses).

### Accommodating Other Commitments

Student athletes, performers, and students with part-time jobs often find that taking one or two courses online gives them the flexibility they need to manage their busy schedules.

## How It Works

Part-time enrolment at Canada e Academy is straightforward:

1. **Choose your course(s):** Browse our [course catalogue](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses) and select the course you need
2. **Register:** Complete the registration process online
3. **Study at your own pace:** Access your course materials and work through them on your schedule
4. **Earn your credit:** Upon successful completion, the credit is added to your Ontario Student Transcript

Your online credits are fully transferable to your day school and count toward your OSSD requirements.

## Support Along the Way

Even as a part-time student, you have access to the same support services as our full-time students, including:

- Qualified Ontario Certified Teachers for each course
- Our student success team for academic support
- Our guidance department for course planning and post-secondary advice

## A Flexible Option for Every Student

Part-time enrolment gives you the flexibility to customise your education while staying connected to your day school community. It truly is the best of both worlds.
