# Reevaluating Your Mental Health

In the busy rhythm of coursework, exams, and planning for the future, it is easy to neglect one of the most important aspects of your life: your mental health. Taking time to check in with yourself -- honestly and without judgement -- is an essential practice for every student.

## Why Check In?

Mental health is not static. It fluctuates based on your circumstances, stress levels, relationships, and many other factors. A strategy that worked for you six months ago may not be working now. Regular check-ins help you stay aware of how you are feeling and make adjustments before small issues become bigger ones.

## Questions to Ask Yourself

Set aside some quiet time and honestly consider these questions:

- **How am I sleeping?** Consistent difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling rested can indicate elevated stress or anxiety.
- **How is my energy level?** Persistent fatigue, even after adequate sleep, can be a sign that something is off.
- **Am I enjoying things I used to enjoy?** Loss of interest in hobbies, social activities, or subjects you once liked can be a sign of burnout or depression.
- **How am I managing my coursework?** If assignments that were once manageable now feel overwhelming, it may be time to reassess your workload or study strategies.
- **Am I connecting with others?** Social withdrawal can both cause and result from mental health challenges.
- **How am I treating myself?** Are you engaging in negative self-talk, skipping meals, or neglecting self-care?

## Strategies for Improvement

If your check-in reveals areas of concern, here are some strategies to consider:

### Adjust Your Workload

If you are feeling overwhelmed, it is okay to slow down. At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/), our self-paced model allows you to adjust your course load as needed. Talk to our [guidance team](https://canadaeacademy.com/guidance) about creating a more manageable schedule.

### Practise Mindfulness

Mindfulness techniques -- such as deep breathing, meditation, or body scans -- can help reduce anxiety and improve focus. Even five minutes a day can make a difference.

### Establish Healthy Habits

Regular exercise, balanced nutrition, adequate sleep, and social connection are the foundations of good mental health. Small, consistent improvements in these areas can have a significant impact.

### Talk to Someone

If you are struggling, do not try to handle it alone. Talk to a trusted friend, family member, teacher, or mental health professional. Canada's Kids Help Phone (1-800-668-6868) and Crisis Services Canada (1-833-456-4566) are available 24/7.

### Set Boundaries

It is okay to say no to things that drain your energy. Setting boundaries around your time, social media use, and commitments can help you protect your mental health.

## You Deserve to Feel Well

Your mental health matters, and taking care of it is not a sign of weakness -- it is a sign of strength and self-awareness. Make mental health check-ins a regular part of your routine, and do not hesitate to seek support when you need it.
