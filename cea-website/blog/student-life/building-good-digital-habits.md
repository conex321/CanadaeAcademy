# Building Good Digital Habits as a Student

As an online student, technology is your primary learning tool. Your computer, internet connection, and digital platforms are how you access lessons, submit assignments, and communicate with teachers. But the same devices that support your education can also be sources of distraction if you are not intentional about how you use them.

Building good digital habits helps you get the most out of your online learning experience while protecting your well-being.

## Separate Study Mode from Leisure Mode

One of the challenges of online learning is that your study device is often the same device you use for entertainment. Create a clear separation between the two:

- Use different browser profiles or windows for school and personal use
- Close social media tabs and non-essential apps during study time
- Consider using website blockers during your study sessions to limit distractions
- When you finish studying, close your school tabs and mentally shift to leisure mode

## Manage Notifications

Notifications from social media, messaging apps, and email can pull your attention away from your studies dozens of times per hour. During study sessions:

- Turn off non-essential notifications on your phone and computer
- Set your phone to "Do Not Disturb" mode
- Check messages during breaks rather than in the middle of a lesson

## Practise Good Email Habits

As an online student, email is your primary communication tool with teachers and administration. Develop professional email habits:

- Use a clear, descriptive subject line
- Address your teacher by name
- Write in complete sentences with proper grammar and spelling
- Be specific about what you need (e.g., "I have a question about Assignment 3 in Unit 2")
- Check your email regularly so you do not miss important messages

## Organise Your Digital Files

Keep your coursework organised in a logical folder structure on your computer:

- Create a folder for each course
- Within each course folder, create subfolders for notes, assignments, and resources
- Name your files descriptively (e.g., "ENG4U-Essay-Draft-1" rather than "Document")
- Back up your work regularly, either to a cloud service or an external drive

## Take Screen Breaks

Spending long periods staring at a screen can cause eye strain, headaches, and fatigue. Follow the 20-20-20 rule:

- Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds

Also, take longer breaks between study sessions to rest your eyes, stretch, and move around.

## Set Boundaries with Social Media

Social media can be a valuable tool for staying connected, but it can also be a significant time drain. Set boundaries that work for you:

- Limit your daily social media usage (many phones have built-in screen time tracking)
- Avoid checking social media first thing in the morning -- start with something productive instead
- Be mindful of how social media makes you feel, and step away if it is causing stress or anxiety

## Protect Your Sleep

Screen time before bed can interfere with your sleep quality. Try to:

- Stop using screens at least 30 minutes before bed
- Use night mode or blue light filters on your devices in the evening
- Charge your phone outside your bedroom to avoid late-night scrolling

## Use Technology Intentionally

Technology is a powerful tool when used intentionally. At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/), our platform is designed to help you learn effectively -- but the habits you bring to your study sessions matter just as much as the courses themselves.

By building good digital habits now, you set yourself up for success not only in school but in the technology-driven workplace that awaits you.
