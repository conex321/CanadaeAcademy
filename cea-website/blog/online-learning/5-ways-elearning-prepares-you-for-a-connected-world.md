# 5 Ways e-Learning Prepares You for a More Connected World

In today's modern society, we often take for granted just how connected our world has become. The traditional system of schooling, with students gathered in cramped classrooms for communal instruction within strictly scheduled instructional periods, has remained largely unchanged for over 150 years. Meanwhile, technology has revolutionised the way we work, communicate, and live.

*It begs the question: why not embrace a learning system that celebrates, and prepares students for, our modern, internationally connected world?*

Online learning platforms, such as [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/), offer that modern spin on this traditional goal. Here are five ways e-learning can help prepare students for life in a more connected world:

## 1. See Perspectives from Different Cultures

In our modern age, it has never been easier to communicate with people from all walks of life. Online learning facilitates the sharing of ideas not just between people in the same classroom, but with those from [around the world](https://canadaeacademy.com/international-students). Students can be exposed to the varying perspectives of those living elsewhere, under varying conditions, within our global community. With modern technology, these people can come together and learn how things work in different countries.

## 2. Learn Modern Technical Skills

Modern technology brings many new opportunities, but to use those opportunities, one must understand how to use this technology. School has always taught "hidden skills." A student writing an essay may be focusing on research or composition but will also be practising typing. Online learning teaches hidden skills that are increasingly in demand -- things as transferable as professional online communication and skills as concrete as increasing technological literacy. Modern employers increasingly demand these types of skills, and online learning provides them.

## 3. Learn How to Communicate with an International Audience

With access to people all over the world, students have the opportunity not just to learn but to teach, to share their perspectives with people and audiences they may otherwise not have been able to reach. Social barriers and misunderstandings can make communication difficult even between people of similar backgrounds and cultures. Online learning gives students practice with speaking to international sensibilities and breaking through cultural barriers -- an essential skill in today's internationally connected world.

## 4. Learn Modern Research Skills

Modern students have access to the summation of human knowledge, all in the palm of their hand. However, with this can come not only a great deal of false information but also information overload. With instructors and a community of students who are inherently inclined toward understanding how to effectively use the internet, students will be better prepared to take advantage of technology and become the most educated generation in history.

## 5. Learn Independent Work Habits to Keep Up with Modern and International Competition

With international connections comes international competition. Our globalised world has allowed people not just to commute around the world for employment but to work for employers around the world from the comfort of their own homes. Much modern employment requires people who can work independently, who can form habits of responsibility that allow them to work without the supervision of an office. Online learning naturally teaches these habits in the regular course of teaching typical school subjects.

Our traditional schools were designed around the challenges of the 19th century. But with how increasingly connected we are becoming in the 21st century, students are facing many new challenges as well as many new opportunities. Online learning platforms, such as [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/), utilise the advantages of modern society to better prepare students for what they are facing right now, and what they will continue to face in the future.
