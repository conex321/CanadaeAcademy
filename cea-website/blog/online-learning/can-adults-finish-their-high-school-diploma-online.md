# Can Adults Finish Their High School Diploma Online?

It happens all the time: people decide to pursue a new career path only to discover they cannot because they never completed their high school diploma. In some cases, they already have a diploma but realise they need one extra credit -- say [ENG4U (Grade 12 English)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng4u) or [MCV4U (Grade 12 Calculus and Vectors)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mcv4u) -- that they did not take before graduation. Many feel discouraged by this barrier, but thanks to modern online schools, finishing those remaining credits has never been more straightforward. With flexible scheduling, interactive lessons, and support from certified teachers, adult learners can complete their remaining credits entirely online.

If you are worried about deadlines or how to transfer credits, here are some frequently asked questions and answers to help you get started.

## Is It Too Late to Go Back to High School?

It is never too late. You can earn your high school diploma at any age, and here at [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com), we have many resources specifically for mature students. The online format makes it very easy to go back to school at any age, as our alumni can attest.

## How Does Online School Work?

At Canada e Academy, all of our lessons are recorded, and students can access them at any time. Tests and assignments also have no strict deadlines, so you can move through the course at your own pace. Once you complete all of the assessments, you earn the credit for the course.

## Can I Finish My Last Year of High School Online?

Yes. You can complete any year of high school online. In fact, the highly flexible schedule allowed by our learning management system makes this an ideal option for people who are returning to high school to complete those last few credits and may not have time to attend an in-person school every day.

## Can You Get Your High School Diploma Online?

Absolutely. As long as you are attending an online high school that is inspected by the Ontario Ministry of Education, like Canada e Academy, and you fulfil all the OSSD requirements, you can earn your Ontario Secondary School Diploma online.

## How Do You Graduate from Online School?

When you sign up and start working on your [OSSD requirements](https://canadaeacademy.com/blog/ouac-ocas/understanding-ossd-requirements-and-pathways), simply let our administration and guidance departments know that you wish to graduate. Once you have completed your courses, let our staff know if you wish to submit your marks for any post-secondary programmes. We will ensure that your marks are sent appropriately and that you receive your diploma so you can continue with your educational pathway.

## Do You Graduate Faster in Online School?

That is up to you. At Canada e Academy, you can move through courses at your own pace. You have to be enrolled for at least 28 days, though you have up to 12 months to complete a course. That means that if you have more time to dedicate to a course, or if you simply find the material easier to understand, you can complete it more quickly. Rather than sticking to a rigid schedule, the school moves at your pace.

## Flexible Scheduling for Busy Adults

One of the most significant benefits of taking high school courses online is the flexibility that virtual school provides. Not only does it save you the time it takes to commute to and from campus each day, but by taking asynchronous classes, you can watch the lessons and complete your work at any time that works for you. This is especially helpful for mature students who are juggling work or raising children on top of their education.

Additionally, by being able to set up your school schedule around your personal life, you can avoid having to quit your job or find childcare in order to go back to school. This can help save a considerable amount of time, money, and stress.

## Upgrading Your Marks

If you were able to take some high school courses earlier in your life, you might wish to upgrade your marks for those courses. Because you already have a base understanding of the content, taking courses virtually allows you to work at a faster pace than you would in a classroom setting. You can move quickly through the content you already know and spend more time focusing on new or challenging concepts in order to get the best grade possible.

Upgrading courses can help you have a better chance of getting into post-secondary institutions or landing higher-paying jobs upon graduation.

If you are interested in returning to high school to earn your diploma, or even just complete a few more courses, [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com) may be the right fit for you.
