# Do Students Get Better Marks Online?

Many people -- students, parents, and teaching staff alike -- believe that taking a course online is a sure-fire path to an easy mark. This idea is highly misleading and has become damaging to the overall perception of academic integrity within the field of e-learning. To help set the record straight, here is a breakdown of the real reasons we believe our students often achieve higher grades in our online courses. Hint: it is not because they are easier.

At Canada e Academy, we hold ourselves to the same standards of integrity as any traditional day school. These high standards mean that all of our instructors are in good standing with the Ontario College of Teachers and are available to respond to student questions on a daily, one-on-one basis via email. The course content and evaluations we use in our online platform are comparable to those students are expected to work through at their day schools. We also require every student completing a course through our platform to write their final exam with approved supervision.

As a result of these measures taken to ensure the quality of education we provide, we are proud to be inspected by the Ontario Ministry of Education to grant OSSD credits. In fact, credits completed through us are viewed by post-secondary institutions equally to those completed through traditional day schools, with hundreds of students moving on to post-secondary using one or more credits earned through us.

So, if all these factors are logistically the same, why do students tend to achieve greater success in online courses as compared to their achievement in traditional day school classes? There are a number of factors, all of which we believe work together to produce the improved results we typically see.

## Self-Paced Learning

The major difference with our courses is that we do not impose deadlines on students for when they have to complete their coursework -- all the learning is done at your own pace through our virtual environment. This added flexibility is particularly beneficial for students with special needs (accessibility issues, developmental delays, injury-related accommodations, and so on), as we are better able to accommodate these needs throughout the entire course, rather than just at points of assessment. With self-paced learning, there is no pressure to go along with the pace of the group. You can move quickly through lessons if you find their content easy or familiar, or take your time if you find it challenging or complex. With Canada e Academy, you have the freedom to choose how little or how long you spend in any of our courses.

## Flexible Hours

Unlike traditional classroom settings, online learning allows you to tailor your study hours to fit your specific schedule -- even if that schedule changes from week to week. Many of our students are highly involved in extracurriculars, with some pursuing professional sporting or performing careers, while others have full-time jobs and families to tend to. In these cases, traditional day schools simply cannot provide the same level of instruction to these students as they can to their less over-extended peers who are able to attend classes for several hours a day, every day. With our self-paced model, students who study better at different times of the day are able to optimise their learning schedules.

## Reduced Stress

By allowing you to review lessons as many times as you need, including the ability to pause and rewind the instructor as often as you like, you are able to work through course content at your own pace. This eliminates the classroom anxiety often felt when a teacher changes the slide too fast and you are the only one who did not finish copying the information down, but you are too shy to ask them to go back. Similarly, taking tests only when you feel fully prepared allows you to be in control of your own success. Many students who experience test anxiety also find it less stressful to write tests on their own and in a location where they feel comfortable -- two features that are standard for every evaluation in an online course.

## Removal of Social Anxiety

The social environment of traditional schools can be extremely distracting, even taxing, on the minds of teenagers. Online schooling removes the immediate anxiety and distraction of social pressures within the classroom, allowing you to focus more intently on your schoolwork. It also allows you to reach out for additional help without fear of judgement from eavesdropping peers. And for students with existing social anxieties that discourage or prevent them from actively participating in traditional classroom environments, there is no participation penalty to their overall grade when they are unable to volunteer responses in group settings.

## Accelerated Completion Is Always an Option

For gifted students who can often find traditional classrooms under-stimulating, online courses encourage them to stay motivated and productive. With our courses, although the content itself is still taught at a standardised level, you are able to progress through the course at any speed you choose, unaffected by the pace of your peers or by predetermined deadlines. If you choose, you can complete a course in as little as four weeks and begin the next level immediately afterwards. Thus, for dedicated and capable students, early graduation becomes entirely achievable through online schooling.

So, if you are trying to determine whether you are going to be able to earn the grades you want by taking a course online, the truthful answer is: it is up to you. At the end of the day, online courses are not easier -- they are simply different. To excel online, you will need to rethink your study strategy, or perhaps develop one altogether. But if you are disciplined, driven, and willing to ask for help when you need it, self-paced learning may very well be the answer to achieving your academic goals.
