# Online Learning for International Students

Canada is one of the most popular destinations for international students, thanks to its world-class universities, welcoming culture, and strong post-graduation work opportunities. If you are an international student looking to study in Canada, earning Ontario high school credits online is a smart and flexible way to prepare.

## Why Choose Ontario Credits?

Ontario's education system is recognised and respected worldwide. Credits earned through Ontario schools -- including [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/) -- are official Ontario credits that are fully recognised by Canadian universities and colleges. An Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD) is accepted by post-secondary institutions across Canada and around the world.

## How It Works

At Canada e Academy, international students can:

- **Study from their home country:** All courses are delivered entirely online, so you can earn Ontario credits from anywhere in the world
- **Learn at their own pace:** Our self-paced model allows you to balance your online courses with your local school commitments or other responsibilities
- **Prepare for Canadian universities:** By completing Ontario prerequisites, you ensure that you meet the admission requirements for Canadian post-secondary programmes

## Popular Courses for International Students

International students commonly take the following courses to prepare for Canadian university applications:

- [ENG4U Grade 12 English](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng4u)

- [SPH4U Physics](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sph4u)

## ESL Support

For students whose first language is not English, Canada e Academy offers English as a Second Language (ESL) courses at five levels. These courses are designed to help newcomers develop the English language skills needed for academic success and daily life in Canada.

## Applying to Canadian Universities

International students apply to Ontario universities through OUAC using the 105 application stream. Our administration team submits your transcripts directly to OUAC, and our [guidance team](https://canadaeacademy.com/guidance) can help you navigate the application process, including:

- Selecting the right programmes
- Understanding admission requirements and deadlines
- Preparing supplementary applications
- Planning your course completion to align with OUAC collection dates

## Time Zone Flexibility

Because our courses are entirely asynchronous, time zones are not a barrier. You can study at whatever time of day works best for you, regardless of where you are located. There are no live classes that require you to be online at a specific time.

## Getting Started
