# How Online Learning Is Changing the Future of Education

As parents and families look at their children's education, one could not blame them for being a bit bewildered at how different things have become in just the last few years. Education is a quickly changing and advancing field, and the school of today is not the school that parents and families may have expected. With new trends, advances in technology, and shifting social attitudes towards schooling, we can also expect education to continue evolving. In fact, we can identify one significant change -- an increasing emphasis on online learning -- and examine how it is transforming other aspects of education along with it.

## 1. Greater Accessibility, Variety, and Choice

One major advantage many students are already experiencing with online learning is the fact that it is much more accessible. Students with mobility concerns have one less issue to worry about, as online learning can be accessed from nearly any location. But online learning does not just allow students to get to school more easily -- it allows them to get to different schools more easily. As many students advancing towards university know, not all schools offer all courses, and few things can be more academically crushing than realising you are not eligible for your preferred post-secondary programme because your high school did not offer a prerequisite course. With online learning, students are not limited to the courses offered by the schools in their geographic vicinity, and they may be surprised by the [wide variety of courses available online](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses). This advantage even extends beyond just course offerings. Some students may find that certain schools do not fit their style of learning, and with online options, they are able to explore more alternatives.

## 2. Easier Family Involvement

As online learning has become more widespread, parents and families have found themselves able to get a better look at what their children are doing in school. Some parents have been surprised by things like curriculum content, teacher skill, and even their own children's behaviour and educational habits once they were able to observe the lessons their children were attending. This increased access has also allowed families greater involvement in their children's learning. From making it easier to help explain concepts, to being able to see when their children may need to work on particular habits or skills, nobody knows a student better than the student's family. An increased ability for parents and families to be involved with their children's learning has been shown to correlate with higher educational outcomes. Online learning allows parents and families the option of greater involvement, and more options allow families to help tailor learning to fit their particular children.

## 3. Increased Independence

One concern some people may have with online learning is that students are given more independence. They may think that students will have less support than they would with in-person learning. That is indeed a possible outcome depending on the school involved, and some students may even be comfortable with that. However, other schools strive to give students as much support as they need -- arguably even more support than traditional schools -- while also offering them the independence to tailor their learning experiences to their own needs.

For example, at [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com), students can contact their teachers at any time, and responses are guaranteed within 24 hours. Many students find this more convenient than only having easy access to their teacher during designated class time and having to compete for that time with all of the other students in class. Email conversations can also allow more complex questions, as students can more clearly think about what they are asking and teachers can more clearly explain their responses. Additionally, office hours are held at least once per week to allow real-time conversation. However, if students do not need this time, they are not obligated to use it. Rather, they can use their time for whatever best suits their needs.

That may mean more time reviewing lessons, as lessons can be paused, rewound, fast-forwarded, and re-watched as many times as required, at any time a student likes. Maybe the student just needs some time away from class for any number of reasons, from other obligations to simply resting and taking care of their own mental health. Or perhaps a student may wish to spend more time on a particular assignment. Since online learning allows for asynchronous learning, at Canada e Academy, assignments do not have rigid due dates. If you need to spend more time on one, you can, but if another assignment, lesson, or unit is less difficult, then that one can be advanced through quickly. In fact, courses can be completed in as little as four weeks or take as long as 12 months, depending on how much time you require to complete all the material to the best of your ability. Online learning allows new methods of support while also enabling students to direct their own learning in ways that work best for them.

The future can be difficult to predict, but one thing that most people agree on is that online learning is changing education, and will likely continue to do so. But as schools, students, and families become more accustomed to these changes, they can bring about many advantages and give students even stronger opportunities for success.
