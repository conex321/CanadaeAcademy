# Creating the Optimal Workspace for Online Learning

One of the things our students love most about our platform is that it allows them to complete their studies from anywhere with an internet connection. The flexibility online learning allows for is far and away its best feature, but is studying from just anywhere really the most productive? Here are three things to keep in mind as you work towards building your optimal workspace.

## 1. Separate Your Space

First things first, the ideal workspace needs to be separated from your personal and family spaces. If you think of your home in terms of zones, you probably already have a zone for eating, one for sleeping, and one for general living; now you need one for working. When creating a learning space, it is best not to overlap with one typically used for another purpose, as this can lead to distractions and potential conflict. No matter the size of your space, try to set up an area with a desk, good lighting, and a comfortable chair so that you know you mean business whenever you are there.

For some students, setting up that ideal workspace within the home is not possible, but that is no reason to worry. Your local library or a neighbourhood cafe can work wonderfully. When choosing your study spot, take some time to really observe the environment for noise level and potential distractions. You will also want to make sure that the available seating is both comfortable and supportive.

## 2. Determine and Destroy Distractions Before They Wreak Havoc

Even after you have gone through the process of setting up or selecting your ideal workspace, you are still going to need to spend some time identifying distractions and deciding on a plan to get rid of them. Here are some common distracting factors and potential solutions:

- **Think about what is in sight of your workspace.** Even a TV that is switched off or a street-facing window can become distracting. Position yourself so that your sightlines will not pull your focus away.
- **Your phone.** When it comes time to buckle down, turn your phone on silent, keep it out of sight and ideally out of reach. If you absolutely have to have it around, keep it face down and silence all social or app notifications.
- **Your computer itself** can pose additional distractions. Close all non-course-related tabs and turn off desktop notifications for social sites for the duration of your study session.
- **Other people.** Particularly when working on online courses, it can look to others as though you are simply watching videos or browsing the web. Communicate with those around you and make them aware of your study habits so they do not interrupt you.

## 3. Set Yourself Up for Success, Not Stress

A huge part of creating a great workspace is making sure you have the right tools at your disposal. Many students also find investing in over-the-ear headphones to be worthwhile, due to their increased noise-cancelling features.

And finally, perhaps the best way to prepare yourself for success and avoid stress is to declutter your workspace. Organisation is often overlooked by students designing functional online workspaces, simply because there are rarely any physical files to keep in order. Saving all your files to your desktop and naming them along the lines of "Assignment FINAL FINALFINAL" is asking for trouble. If this sounds like you, spend some time sorting through your online files and organising them in a way that makes sense for you — consider it like creating a virtual filing cabinet that will allow you to streamline your review come exam time.

In the end, having all the tools you might need at your fingertips will not only physically prepare you to tackle your lessons efficiently; it will also reduce your stress and mentally prepare you for productive learning.
