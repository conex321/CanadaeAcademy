# How Online Learning Can Help with Anxiety

For many young students, anxiety around school and social situations is a very real issue. Though brick-and-mortar schools do their best to accommodate students with anxiety, it is not always easy. With a classroom full of other students who also need attention and consideration, it can be hard for teachers to support everyone. However, online schools like Canada e Academy do a great deal to help students lessen their anxiety and be successful in their courses.

## Reduction of Social Pressure

One benefit of online school for students with anxiety is that it can reduce the need for social interactions that may be overwhelming. [Online learning](https://canadaeacademy.com) allows students to participate in class discussions and complete assignments without the pressure of in-person interactions. This can help students with anxiety feel more comfortable and confident in their learning.

At Canada e Academy, our lessons are all pre-recorded lectures played over a presentation — there are no live classes. This way, you do not have to log in at a certain time and you never have to worry about being absent or late.

For some anxiety sufferers, the idea of having to call or video chat a teacher can be nerve-wracking. With Canada e Academy, if you have questions, you can email your teacher and expect a response within one business day. This allows you to still reach out for help and get the answers you need, all without having to speak to your teacher in person.

## Flexible and Personalised Learning

Online learning can give students a more flexible and personalised learning environment. This can be especially helpful for students with anxiety, as it allows them to learn at their own pace and in a setting that is comfortable and familiar.

In most physical schools, students only have a set amount of time to complete a course. They have to hand in assignments on certain dates and write tests at the same time as everyone else. For students who struggle with anxiety, this can be a significant source of stress. No two students learn the same, so expecting them all to work on the same timeline is not always feasible.

At Canada e Academy, students work entirely on their own schedule. You can complete courses in as little as four weeks or take up to one year. There are no set due dates for tests or assignments, so you can hand things in as you get to them. You are also able to set your final exam for whatever day and time works best for you.

Let us take a look at [Grade 12 University English (ENG4U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng4u), a course required for graduation and for university applications. In this course, there are four units, each with several assignments and unit tests. While some students might breeze through the Poetry or Literary Criticism units, other students may need longer with those concepts. By taking the course online, the students who want to can move through quickly and jump into the next unit, while other students in the same course can spend longer on those sections, taking their time to really understand concepts and complete assignments.

By allowing students to move at a pace that works for them, online courses can help lessen anxiety about due dates and deadlines, which can help students get the grades they want.

## Support Services

Online school can also provide access to a wide range of support services and resources for students with anxiety. At Canada e Academy, we take our students' mental health and well-being seriously.

If students reach out to our office because they find they are having mental health issues and need help completing their courses, we are always happy to offer assistance. Whether they need to put their courses on a temporary hold, or need help creating a study plan to ease some of their stress, we are willing to work with our students to come up with solutions that work for them.

Overall, online school can be a valuable option for students with anxiety, as it provides a flexible, personalised, and supportive learning environment. By taking advantage of the resources and support available through online learning, students with anxiety can thrive and succeed in their education.
