# Why Online School Is Ideal for Mature Students

There are plenty of reasons why someone may have had to leave high school before graduating. However, having a high school diploma is extremely beneficial and can open many personal and professional doors. A diploma allows you to pursue post-secondary education and secure more stable, better-paying employment. It also sets the foundation for many life skills that are needed to live a successful life.

Going back to high school as a mature student can be daunting -- it may have been years since you last set foot in a classroom, and your classmates will likely be much younger than you. However, these worries should not stop you from pursuing your diploma. At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com), we want to help adults continue their education by making earning their diplomas as accessible as possible.

Pursuing education at any age is a worthwhile endeavour. We firmly believe that learning is a lifelong pursuit. Whether in a classroom setting, at work, or in daily life, we are always learning new things. The experience you have gained since leaving high school may actually benefit you when you return to school, making the material easier to grasp. Additionally, it is not uncommon for career changes to require people to go back to school later in life.

Here is how Canada e Academy makes going back to school as a mature student much more manageable, accessible, and conducive to success.

## No Set Class Times

Finding the time to go back to school is one of the biggest deterrents for mature students. At Canada e Academy, we offer our students full flexibility when it comes to attending lessons. Our asynchronous classes do not have a set time that you need to be online. You will not have to attend any live lectures or work through any in-class assignments. Instead, the learning materials for the course you are taking are accessible to you around the clock, meaning you can work on completing your credits whenever you have time.

This flexibility means that completing your education while juggling jobs, childcare, and other life events is entirely feasible. You can complete your work after your shift, once the kids have gone to bed, or at whatever other time works best for you.

## No Strict Deadlines

At Canada e Academy, there are no strict deadlines for assignments like there would be at a traditional in-person school. Instead, assignments only need to be submitted by the final date of the course. We understand that not everyone has the same commitments, and having the same due date for every student simply does not make sense.

Not only does this give you the chance to complete assignments when you have the time, but it also allows you to spend more time refining your work so that you can submit the highest quality product you are capable of. Often, when students face tight deadlines, they feel rushed and do not hand in their best work. By offering flexible timelines, we give you all the time you need to demonstrate your understanding and achieve the best grade possible.

## No Commuting to Campus

Not having to commute to and from a physical campus can save a significant amount of time and money. Not every student has access to a vehicle, meaning some would spend hours on public transport each day. Not only does this cut into personal time, but it also limits the ability to maintain a job outside of school.

By eliminating a daily commute, you can continue to do the things you enjoy outside of school. A healthy school-life balance promotes overall well-being, which is critical for academic success.

## Study at Your Own Pace

Our flexible model allows you to finish your courses as quickly as possible or take as long as you need. Courses can be completed in as little as four weeks or worked through over the course of an entire year.

This is especially beneficial for mature students who may already have an understanding of the material presented in the courses they are taking or who are upgrading their marks. You can move through your courses much faster than you would in a traditional school, meaning you can reach graduation sooner. Students who need a bit of extra time can take longer to complete their courses so they can continue to work or manage their daily lives on top of their education.

## Customise Your Course Load

You have the option to choose between full-time or part-time enrolment. Many of our students take only one or two courses at a time. Because our courses can be completed over the course of a year with no strict deadlines for completing lessons or assignments, they fit easily into your busy schedule.

For example, if you are only one math credit short of your high school diploma, you can take [MHF4U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mhf4u) or [SCH4U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sch4u) online and be finished in a matter of weeks.

## Online School Is Conducive to Success

When you are considering going back to school later in life, that decision indicates a genuine desire to learn and grow. Because of this motivation, you are much more likely to complete your education.

Our Ontario College of Teachers certified instructors at Canada e Academy are committed to helping you succeed and are available to you whenever you need help or guidance throughout your schooling. Although classes are virtual and asynchronous, you will have access to your instructor during set office hours. During this time, you can get assistance on assignments, ask questions about the material, and seek guidance regarding your education.
