# How to Maximise Your Productivity While Learning from Home

Taking courses online is undoubtedly a different experience from taking them in a traditional classroom setting. Being able to study independently from the comfort of your own home is a significant change from the bell-driven rotation of students from room to room. For most of us, this is the model we have learned to learn by. Adjusting to anything else represents a big change, particularly when the new model has you working from the space you currently associate with kicking back and relaxing.

At Canada e Academy, we recognise that bringing schoolwork into the home domain presents a particular set of challenges for productivity. For those new to learning from home, or those who have never quite mastered it, we have got some tips and tricks to help keep you focused and productive.

## 1. Create a Schedule

Having a schedule is the first key to success: if you do not make time for your studies, you will not find time to study. If routine is important for you, keep your e-learning schedule similar to a traditional day school. If you had trouble focusing early in the morning, switch up your schedule to hours that work for you. If you do not work well with back-to-back classes, schedule breaks in between.

The flexible schedule is one of the best parts about e-learning, so do not be afraid to take advantage of it. That said, it is still best to designate significant chunks of time (at least three to four hours per day) when you can attend to your studies uninterrupted, and it is best to keep these hours consistent day to day.

## 2. Choose Your Workspace Carefully

Find a quiet space in your home where you can work without distractions. Ideally, try to create a workspace that can be solely associated with school from now on. In the same way you associate your kitchen with eating and your bedroom with sleeping, creating a space dedicated to schoolwork will help you focus.

When designating your workspace, pay attention to what helps you be productive. Do you prefer white noise or complete silence? Do you like being able to look out a window, or does it distract you? What kind of lighting do you work best in? These factors can all affect how efficient you are with your studies.

## 3. Take Breaks

Being able to self-motivate and self-discipline are valuable traits when taking courses online, but knowing when to step away is just as important. When creating a schedule for yourself, be sure to schedule designated times for mental breaks.

Experts suggest taking a 10 to 15 minute break every hour or two. When done right, these short breaks will improve your decision-making, creativity, focus, and ability to retain information. Try a trip to the kitchen for a healthy snack or a glass of water. You can even try a 15-minute power nap if you are feeling particularly sluggish. Remember: something is better than nothing.

## 4. Eliminate Distractions

Taking courses online presents several distractions you would not typically encounter in a classroom environment. From pets, parents, or siblings intruding, to social media and the tools of your hobbies, distractions abound in the home. To eliminate them, first you have to identify them.

Whatever you identify as distracting, it is in your best interest to eliminate it from your workspace. Cannot seem to find the willpower to stay off social media? Set time limits or blackout periods on specific apps by going to your device's settings menu.

## 5. Set Attainable Goals

Looking at a list of things that need to be done can be intimidating, even stressful. More often than not, when you do not know where to start, you simply do not start at all. Instead, try setting yourself a series of attainable goals to help you manage the stress of balancing multiple courses.

By chunking and scheduling your tasks, you can make a long list seem more manageable and improve your overall productivity. A good place to start would be looking at what you need to get done by the end of the week and what you should do on a daily basis until then to get it done. Spreading out work over multiple days or weeks can drastically improve your stress levels and will make you feel more productive each day.

At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com), we know how rewarding and effective it can be to learn at your own pace, which is why we have made providing quality, student-centred learning our top priority.
