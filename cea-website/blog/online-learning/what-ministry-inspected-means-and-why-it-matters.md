# What "Ministry Inspected" Means and Why It Matters

With so many educational institutions to choose from, how do you decide? One important way to narrow the field is to look specifically for schools that are Ministry-inspected, like Canada e Academy (BSID #665804).

## What Does "Ministry Inspected" Mean?

This is not simply a new buzzword. For more than 15 years, [the Ontario Ministry of Education](http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/general/elemsec/privsch/questions.html) has been conducting annual inspections of Ontario schools, both public and private, to ensure that schools comply with Ministry policies. Each year, the Ministry lists all inspected schools on [their website](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/private-school-contact-information). They also list any schools that fail these inspections. This ensures Ontario families have access to the data they need to make informed decisions about their children's education.

## How Do I Know if a Private School Is Ministry Inspected?

There are a number of ways. Typically, schools will proudly display their school number on their website. If they do not or you cannot easily find it, ask! A school representative should be able to easily and readily provide you with their school's BSID or MIDENT number -- the number used by the Ministry and other educational institutions to recognise that school within the provincial framework. Or, if you want to be absolutely sure, you can check [the Ministry's annual list of inspected private schools](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/private-school-contact-information).

## Why Should I Care if a School Is Ministry Inspected?

First and foremost: only schools meeting these criteria are eligible to grant credits toward [the Ontario Secondary School Diploma](https://www.ontario.ca/page/earning-your-high-school-diploma). While non-inspected schools may teach valuable information, their courses do not count toward the achievement of the official OSSD. By extension, credits earned in non-inspected schools are often not accepted by colleges and universities.

Attending a Ministry-inspected school also ensures that your credits are recognised by other secondary schools. This allows students the freedom to change schools within Ontario without needing to backtrack or repeat completed credits.

## What Does It Mean to Say a Credit Is "Transferable"?

Credits taken through inspected schools (whether public or private) are necessarily transferable between all Ministry-inspected schools. This is because these institutions uphold the standards of the province-wide curriculum. By attending a Ministry-inspected school, you ensure that you are learning material that is not only valuable but of an appropriate difficulty, and structured in a way that follows modern educational understanding and standards.

There are many ways to learn, and many schools that can teach you similar material, but it is important that when considering your options, only schools certified as "Ministry inspected" will provide you with these all-important benefits that come from upholding province-wide educational standards.
