# Train Your Brain: How Online Learning Builds Focus and Endurance

From ancient classrooms to modern online learning, the impact of education on human growth has always captured our attention. While there are certainly academic benefits of going to school, such as learning content knowledge and skills, there are also a variety of cognitive benefits that come with learning.

## Cognitive Endurance Improves with Practice

It is not always easy to stay focused and give your full attention to a task at hand. Recent research suggests that cognitive endurance has become a form of human capital. What this means is that your ability to engage in and sustain effortful mental activity over a continuous stretch of time is a way by which you increase your chances of achieving academic success, both in the classroom and beyond.

## How Canada e Academy Promotes Cognitive Endurance

Taking online courses at [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com) is a great way to develop cognitive endurance. In an age where the ability to concentrate has become more challenging, the design and delivery of our virtual courses allow you to practise self-directed learning and develop the valuable skill of cognitive endurance.

## Our Course Delivery Model

One of the greatest features of online learning with Canada e Academy is the flexibility it provides in allowing you to customise your schedule and complete any course at your own pace. You can log in to your course and learn at home any time and for any duration. For example, studying a few hours a day will enable you to complete the course in just four weeks. If you require a slower pace, you can take up to 12 months. The benefit of this model is that you can use the flexible pacing of courses to increase your cognitive endurance over time.

## Engaging Course Design

Whether it is [Grade 12 Biology (SBI4U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sbi4u) or [Grade 12 Calculus (MCV4U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mcv4u), Canada e Academy has created a dynamic and interactive multimedia platform for course delivery. Since this approach is far more engaging than simply reading text on a screen, you are able to practise and improve your cognitive endurance throughout the duration of a course. The more engaged you are, the longer you spend focused on a task. And the longer you spend on a task, the more your cognitive endurance increases.

## Assessment and Evaluation

When you are engaged in meaningful and effortful work, assessment and evaluation become opportunities to celebrate your growth and success. Canada e Academy believes that a varied assessment and evaluation strategy best allows teachers to gauge student understanding. This means moving away from random computer-generated multiple-choice tests to evaluations that are teacher-driven and tailored to your strengths.
