# 12 Reasons to Try Online Learning

Whether you are looking to improve your grades, explore a new subject, or get ahead on your post-secondary goals, online learning offers something for everyone. Here are twelve reasons why taking an online course could be one of the best decisions you make for your education.

## 1. Universities Are Looking at Your Grades

Universities collect updated grades throughout the school year. If you need to upgrade a mark or earn a missing prerequisite, online learning makes it possible to do so on your own timeline.

## 2. Tackle Challenging Subjects with Confidence

Taking a difficult subject online can improve your chances of success. At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/), students can replay lessons as many times as needed and master concepts before moving forward. There is no pressure to keep pace with a classroom.

## 3. e-Learning Is the Way of the Future

Online learning is not just a trend -- it is an integral part of modern education. Ontario now requires students to earn two online learning credits for graduation. Getting comfortable with the online format now will serve you well in post-secondary education and the workplace.

## 4. Improve Your Time Management Skills

With the flexibility of self-paced learning comes the responsibility of managing your own time. Taking an online course is an excellent way to develop time management skills that will benefit you in every area of your life.

## 5. It Fits Your Schedule

The flexibility of online learning means you can customise a study schedule that works around your commitments -- whether that includes a part-time job, sports, or other activities. There are no fixed class times at Canada e Academy, so you can study when it suits you best.

## 6. Create Balance in Your Life

If you are pursuing athletics, arts, or other extracurricular interests, online learning allows you to balance those passions with a quality education. You do not have to choose between your goals and your coursework.

## 7. Take the First Step Toward Your Dream Career

For mature students or anyone considering a career change, online learning provides an accessible way to earn the prerequisites needed for post-secondary programmes. At Canada e Academy, you can complete a course in as little as four weeks or take up to a full year.

## 8. Embrace a Growth Mindset

Online learning encourages you to view challenges as opportunities for growth. By working through difficult material independently, you build resilience and confidence in your own abilities.

## 9. Increase Your Self-Awareness and Independence

Self-directed learning requires you to understand your own working style and habits. This self-awareness helps you set realistic goals and develop the independence that is essential for success beyond high school.

## 10. Strengthen Your Communication Skills

Online courses teach you to communicate your thoughts clearly and professionally through written communication. Whether you are emailing a teacher or contributing to a discussion forum, you are building skills that translate directly to the professional world.

## 11. Broaden Your Perspective

Online learning brings together students from different backgrounds and locations. Taking courses outside your usual comfort zone -- whether it is an elective in a new subject area or a course with peers from across Canada -- can broaden your perspective and spark new interests.

## 12. Investing in Your Education Is Always Worth It

Whether you are upgrading marks for post-secondary, exploring a new field, or learning something for the sake of personal growth, investing in your education always pays dividends.
