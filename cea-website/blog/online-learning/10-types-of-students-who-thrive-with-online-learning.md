# 10 Types of Students Who Thrive with Online Learning

As technology becomes more and more ubiquitous in our lives, online learning is becoming an increasingly attractive option for students. However, many are still hesitant to make the change, and that is perfectly reasonable! At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/), it is our goal to provide an online learning experience that can benefit any student, but we recognise that online learning is not the right fit for everyone. In this blog, we are going to explore the 10 types of students who we have found benefit most from self-directed online learning.

## 1. Students with Medical Issues or Concerns

A wide variety of medical issues can make it difficult for students to regularly attend classes at brick-and-mortar schools. It is one thing to miss the occasional class for an appointment, but for students with chronic medical issues, these missed classes can quickly add up. In some cases, students find themselves having to repeat entire grades. Online schooling can help to remove this barrier, allowing all students access to a quality education regardless of their physical ability.

## 2. Students Who Are Heavily Involved in Extracurricular Activities

For students who are gifted in a particular extracurricular activity, it can be challenging to pursue that talent or skill seriously during their high school years. As with any high-level athletic or artistic pursuit, extensive practice is necessary, as well as games, competitions, tournaments, or recitals, which can often conflict with the constraints of traditional academic schedules. With its nearly limitless flexibility, online learning allows students the ability to balance important academic study with the equally rewarding pursuit of extracurricular activities.

## 3. Students Affected by Bullying

Despite continued efforts from school counsellors, the unfortunate reality remains that most bullying occurs in schools. Not only does bullying negatively impact the physical, mental, and emotional health of its victims, it can also negatively impact their grades and even discourage them from attending school altogether. With online learning, students can continue earning their high school diploma from the comfort and privacy of their own home.

## 4. Students Seeking Early Graduation

Students who have a history of academic excellence, or those identified as "Gifted Learners," may feel understimulated by a regular course load. For these students, taking additional courses online can be a great way to keep them feeling challenged. It can also allow them to accelerate their high school journey and work toward early graduation.

## 5. Students Who Struggle with Certain Subjects

Students who struggle in particular subject areas can use online learning to their advantage to gain flexibility in their schedule. They may choose to tackle the difficult subject online to take advantage of unlimited replay of lesson content or extended timelines for completion, encouraging mastery of concepts before assessment. Alternatively, they may choose to get an easier subject out of the way online to afford them additional time in their day school schedule.

## 6. Students Who Experience Anxiety

It is generally understood that many students who experience anxiety are triggered and exacerbated by factors in their day-to-day surroundings. For teenagers, the social stresses and rigorous academic expectations of the traditional school experience can be a huge contributing factor. In extreme cases, some students find themselves unable to attend classes with their peers, particularly around peak-stress times like finals. With online learning, students are afforded a much higher degree of flexibility over their schedule and surroundings, allowing them to care for themselves and their education.

## 7. Students Whose Families Spend Significant Time Abroad

In today's interconnected world, many careers require frequent or extended international travel, which can be difficult for those with adolescent children. With Canada e Academy, parents whose work requires them to spend significant time abroad can keep their children close while still keeping their education consistent. With fully online, self-paced courses and no designated "instructional hours," Canada e Academy allows students to work toward an Ontario diploma from home or abroad.

## 8. Students Pursuing Workplace Experience

In the later years of high school, many students begin exploring employment opportunities. Gaining early experience in the workforce can be extremely valuable, but with traditional schooling models, so much of the day is already dedicated toward school. With online learning, students have the flexibility to schedule their education around opportunities that will benefit them later on.

## 9. Students Seeking to Increase Their Technological Literacy

In today's modern workforce, being comfortable and knowledgeable when it comes to using technology is a skill that is increasingly valuable to employers. When taking courses online, students are learning not only the curriculum-based content but also how to navigate modern technology in a professional setting.

## 10. Students Living Internationally but Pursuing Post-Secondary in Canada

At Canada e Academy, students are able to earn Ontario Secondary School credits from anywhere in the world. For [international students](https://canadaeacademy.com/international-students), or Canadian citizens living abroad but planning to return to Canada for post-secondary study, this is a fantastic way to stay on track with academic studies without having to prematurely uproot your family.

Online learning provides countless benefits that help a wide variety of learners. If you think online learning may be right for you, Canada e Academy offers [more than 170 courses](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses) and provides all the tools you need to get the most out of your education, online!
