# Online Learning for Mature Students

Education does not have an expiry date. Whether you are looking to complete your Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD), upgrade your marks for a career change, or earn prerequisites for a post-secondary programme, online learning makes it possible to fit education into your adult life.

## Who Is a Mature Student?

In Ontario, a mature student is generally defined as someone who is 18 years of age or older and has been out of school for at least one year. Mature students come from all walks of life:

- Adults who did not complete high school and want to earn their OSSD
- Professionals looking to change careers and need specific prerequisites
- Immigrants and newcomers who need Canadian credits to pursue further education
- Parents who want to return to school after raising their children
- Anyone who wants to improve their academic record

## Why Online Learning Works for Mature Students

Returning to school as an adult comes with unique challenges. You may have work commitments, family responsibilities, or financial constraints that make attending a traditional school impractical. Online learning addresses these challenges directly.

### Flexible Scheduling

At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/), there are no fixed class times. You can study early in the morning, during your lunch break, or late at night -- whatever fits your schedule. This flexibility allows you to balance your education with work, family, and other responsibilities.

### Self-Paced Progress

You are not locked into a rigid timeline. If you need more time on a difficult concept, take it. If you have a busy week at work, you can adjust your study schedule accordingly. You can complete a course in as little as four weeks or take up to a full year.

### Learn from Home

There is no need to commute to a physical school. All you need is a computer and an internet connection. This saves time and money, and makes education accessible regardless of where you live in Canada or around the world.

### Supportive Teachers

Our teachers understand that mature students bring a different perspective and set of challenges to their studies. They are available to provide guidance, feedback, and support throughout your course.

## Common Goals for Mature Students

### Earning the OSSD

If you did not finish high school, you can complete the remaining credits needed for your OSSD through Canada e Academy. Our [guidance team](https://canadaeacademy.com/guidance) can help you determine which credits you still need and create a plan to complete them.

### Upgrading Marks

If you completed high school but need higher marks to gain admission to a post-secondary programme, our upgrade courses allow you to retake a course and aim for a better grade.

### Completing Prerequisites

Many post-secondary programmes require specific high school courses for admission. If you are missing a prerequisite, you can take it online. Popular prerequisite courses include:

- [MHF4U Advanced Functions](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mhf4u)
- [ENG4U English](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/eng4u)
- [SBI4U Biology](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sbi4u)
- [SCH4U Chemistry](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sch4u)
