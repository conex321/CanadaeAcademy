# The Benefits of Taking Math Courses Online

Many people are still sceptical about the effectiveness of taking courses online. Of course, as with in-person learning, there are pros and cons to virtual school. Additionally, because learning is not one size fits all, it may not work for every student to take courses online. However, many students have found online learning to be an integral part of their high school success.

For many students, mathematics is one of the more difficult core high school subjects. That being said, it is also one of the most useful and versatile subjects for students to take. Because of this, taking high school math is extremely important. Taking this course online can be beneficial for both students who excel at math and students who struggle with it.

Let us look at some of the benefits that taking math courses online can provide for high school students.

## Learning at Your Own Pace

One of the greatest benefits of taking any course online is that students can learn at their own pace. While traditional in-person classes work at a set pace to accommodate the average student, with virtual learning, students can take as much or as little time as they need to complete their lessons.

Let us consider two students who chose to [take MHF4U online](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mhf4u), a Grade 12 Advanced Functions course. One of the students loves math and is great at it. The other, however, struggles to grasp the concepts of advanced functions. The first student will likely need less time with the material and may be able to complete the course in only a few weeks. However, the second student can take their time to ensure they really understand each concept before moving on to the next.

If these example students both took the same course in person, the first student may become bored because they find the material too easy. On the other hand, the second student may fall behind their classmates and struggle to keep up, causing them to do worse than they would if they had the time they need to learn.

## Flexible Schedule

Virtual school often uses asynchronous learning methods. This means that students do not have to be in class at a set time each week or attend any live sessions. All the material needed for the course is accessible to students at any time and can be completed at their leisure. Because there is no physical school setting, students can also save time by not having to commute to and from school each day.

Most courses will have a final date by which all work needs to be completed to receive credit; however, on a day-to-day basis, students can spend as much time as they would like learning. This can greatly benefit students who may be juggling other commitments such as high-level sports or various jobs, or for students who do not live close to a school or have access to transportation.

## Replay and Review

Another significant advantage of taking math online is the ability to replay lessons. In a traditional classroom, once the teacher moves on to the next topic, it can be difficult to revisit a concept you did not fully understand. With online courses at [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/), you can go back and rewatch any lesson as many times as you need. This is particularly valuable in math, where understanding one concept often depends on mastering the one that came before it.
