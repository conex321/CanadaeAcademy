# Benefits of Hybrid Online Learning

In the last several years, many students have adopted a hybrid approach to their high school education. This means that while they still attend a traditional physical school for at least some of their courses, they also take some courses through online schooling options. Students and families who are not familiar with this model may be surprised, but there are many reasons students decide to turn to online schooling while still attending a regular physical school.

## Reaching Ahead from Grade 8 to High School

With the rise of online education options, it has become increasingly possible, and popular, for students in Grade 8 to adopt a strategy that lets them get a head start on high school. With online options like [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/) and our [Reach Ahead programme](https://canadaeacademy.com/reach-ahead), students in Grade 8 are able to enrol in one or two Grade 9 courses before beginning Grade 9. Among other advantages, this can allow students to get some mandatory courses out of the way -- such as French, Physical Education, or Geography -- and thus have more room for electives in their first year at a physical high school.

## Reaching Ahead While in High School

The same strategy can still be helpful even once a student has already entered high school. It is not uncommon for students to wish to take a course that is normally meant for the next grade, such as History, Civics, Career Studies, or English, thus allowing them to pick up extra courses and move forward in their education a little faster. Students can even take these courses at any time of the year.

## Timetable Issues

At Canada e Academy, we have heard from many of our students that the reason they initially decided to enrol with us was because their home schools were not able to make their preferred schedules work. Sometimes two courses the student wants or needs are both at the same time, making it impossible to take both. Other times, schools are forced to cancel courses or are not able to offer them in the first place. By taking some courses online, these problems can be solved, and students are able to access courses that they may otherwise have been unable to take.

## Difficult Subjects

Several of our students have said that sometimes, if there is a particular subject they struggle with, they prefer to take that course online. With Canada e Academy's format, there are no due dates, and students are able to set their own schedules and work at their own pace. This way, students can dedicate more time to lessons or assignments they find more difficult while also saving time with topics they are able to grasp more easily. Students can even take more than a full semester to complete their courses -- up to a full year, if needed.

## International Students

International students have many reasons they may like to engage in hybrid learning. Some students wish to earn Ontario credits while in other countries so that they can then use them toward an [Ontario Secondary School Diploma](https://www.ontario.ca/page/earning-your-high-school-diploma), or even a dual diploma with their home jurisdiction. This can open many more options for employment and post-secondary education, including making it much easier to gain acceptance to Canadian universities, especially those in Ontario.

Hybrid learning can be an incredibly useful option for students. Taking some courses online while still attending a physical school opens many opportunities without being a sudden and dramatic change to regular school routines.
