# How e-Learning Prepares Students for Remote Education in University

Universities have been expanding online and hybrid programme offerings at a rapid pace. Increasingly, universities are releasing programmes either entirely online or supplementing conventional programmes with e-learning elements. Learning remotely provides a whole slew of advantages to the modern student. e-Learning also provides students with a way to approach their studies in a holistic way. Instead of being forced to sacrifice their work and interests for full-time studies, students can follow their own schedule, freeing their time up for work or extracurricular activities without feeling overwhelmed.

For Canadian students seeking to enter university, pursuing a programme from an established online high school such as [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/) can be a great way to build a sound university application while also developing vital e-learning skills.

## Test the Waters for Distance Learning

University-level education is a very different learning experience than high school. There is a major emphasis on self-directed learning, where students take charge of their own learning strategies. Passively listening to lectures is not going to lead to success. Students are expected to take an active role in their education and to perform independent research more intensely than they did in high school -- another skill that students often find themselves poorly equipped to handle.

When studying no longer requires students to physically attend lessons, they need to be much more cognisant of their time management and initiative skills. A virtual high school can be an amazing introduction to these remote learning skills, and students can also build familiarity with vital digital skills that they will be using long after graduation as they enter the workforce.

## Foundational Skills Pay the Bills

The best way to see how e-learning prepares you for distance education in university is to jump right in. Our core programme offers every major credit required for application into a top university.

If you are thinking about entering the sciences, then [SCH4U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/sch4u) or Grade 12 Chemistry is going to be essential. In this course, students work to develop a deeper understanding of chemistry, particularly in the communication of scientific data.

Similarly, in [MCR3U](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mcr3u) or Grade 11 Functions, you will add mathematical functions to your skill set, further deepening your experience with linear and quadratic equations. More importantly, you will learn how to apply mathematical reasoning to complex, multi-stage problems.

## How Online Learning Can Set You Up for Success

Canada e Academy is an expert educational institution with extensive experience delivering world-class online learning. We have put a lot of time and energy into developing the best possible e-learning platform. We have also put a lot of thought into how people learn, and have numerous resources to help students master the shift to e-learning.

The e-learning skills you develop in high school are directly transferable to post-secondary study and provide a foundation that will last for a lifetime. In university, students are expected to manage their own schedules and develop effective learning strategies to keep ahead of their studies -- and that is precisely what we teach at Canada e Academy.

## Online Learning Unlocks Higher Education

Students are no longer bound by physical attendance at university, instead being able to learn wherever they have an internet connection. This can be a great experience, allowing for far more flexibility and freedom. However, the rigours of university study cannot be overstated, and a familiarity with the core mechanics of e-learning is essential to truly succeed. The soft skills taught by pursuing an online education at a virtual high school are critical for success -- both when studying remotely for a post-secondary degree and in the workplace after graduation.
