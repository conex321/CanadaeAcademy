# What Is Advanced Functions? A Guide to Taking It Online

In Ontario, [Advanced Functions (Grade 12)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mhf4u) is a Grade 12 mathematics course that focuses on, as the name implies, more advanced functions than those studied in the [Grade 11 Functions course (MCR3U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mcr3u).

## What Do You Do in Advanced Functions?

In Grade 12 Advanced Functions, students broaden their understanding of rates of change. They do this by investigating the properties of polynomial, rational, trigonometric, and logarithmic functions. They then develop techniques for combining and applying these functions in a variety of situations.

## Can I Do Calculus Without Advanced Functions?

While not a mandatory requirement for earning an [Ontario Secondary School Diploma](https://www.ontario.ca/page/earning-your-high-school-diploma), Advanced Functions is required in order to take the [Calculus and Vectors course (MCV4U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mcv4u). You can take MHF4U either before or at the same time as completing MCV4U. Calculus and Vectors is itself a prerequisite for many post-secondary programmes, especially those in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields.

## Why Else Might Students Wish to Take This Course?

Students may also wish to take Advanced Functions without planning to also take Calculus and Vectors. While it is a common misconception that Advanced Functions is only useful to those planning a career in a STEM field, it can also simply help them improve their understanding of mathematics to a level beyond the average Ontario secondary school graduate. The improved mathematics, analysis, and problem-solving skills earned in this course can help people in many areas of life, both in post-secondary education and outside of school environments.

## Prerequisite Courses

Before starting [Grade 12 Advanced Functions (MHF4U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mhf4u), students must have already completed **either**:

- [Grade 11 Functions (MCR3U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mcr3u)

**or**

- [Grade 12 Mathematics for College Technology (MCT4C)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mct4c)

## Advantages of Taking MHF4U Advanced Functions Online

Taking Advanced Functions as an online course has several advantages compared to taking it in traditional schools.

**Move at your own pace:** Many students consider Advanced Functions to be an intimidating course. With Canada e Academy, the ability to move through a course at your own pace is designed to be an advantage accessible to any student. If you are having trouble with a particular lesson or concept, you can spend as much time as you need in mastering it before eventually moving on to the next idea.

**Review any lesson at any time:** Many different concepts are studied in the Advanced Functions course. When approaching the end of a unit or the end of the course, you may find it useful to return to old lessons for review. At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/), students can simply view the original lessons and materials again at any time.

**Multimedia lessons:** In a course like Advanced Functions, multimedia lessons can be crucial. From practice quizzes interspersed within lessons, to seamless transition between text and video, to interactive graphs and diagrams, multiple methods of communication can help reach students with many different learning styles.

## Taking Advanced Functions as an Upgrade Course

[Advanced Functions (Upgrade)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mhf4u-upgrade), being a course that is important for entrance to many post-secondary programmes, is one of our more popular upgrade courses. Many students may not realise that they can upgrade high school courses online, but Canada e Academy offers many [upgrade courses](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/upgrade-courses), designed for students who have already completed the course before but wish to take it again to improve their grade. These courses are condensed and can be completed more quickly than standard courses.
