# Creating a Study Schedule as an Online Student

If you have recently made the switch from a traditional semester school to taking all (or most) of your courses online, the flexibility we offer might seem a bit overwhelming. Not to worry — Canada e Academy is here with some tips on establishing a study schedule that will help keep you on track across all your courses.

## Decide How Many Courses to Work On at a Time

First, it is important to decide how many courses you feel comfortable working on at once. You might prefer to focus your attention on just one or two courses per month, working through each course in succession. Or perhaps you would rather stick to the semester-style pacing of working on four courses over a period of four months. Or maybe you crave variety, so taking multiple courses and working your way through all of them at the same time would be more your style.

Whatever you decide, keep in mind that you must be enrolled in a course for a minimum of 30 days before you are eligible to request your final report card, and you have up to 12 months to complete. If you have signed up for more courses than you are confident you can complete in one year, simply get in touch with us to have one or more of your courses put on hold until you are ready to start.

## Build Your Personalised Study Schedule

Once you have your courses and overall pacing set, it is time to work on creating a personalised study schedule. The best way to approach this is to consult your course handbooks (attached to your welcome email) to determine the breakdown of each of your courses. Then, divide the lessons and assignments based on your preferred pace. To do this, you will need to decide whether you are going to work on your courses every day, a couple of times a week, or maybe just on the weekends.

If you need help creating your study schedule, our Student Success team is always willing to help. And remember, there is no right or wrong answer here — it all comes down to what works best for you.

## Establish a Routine

Whatever you decide, it is always a good idea to create a regular routine with dedicated days and times to log on and work through your courses. The flip side of flexible learning is that it is easy to get caught up with life's other tasks and let your e-work fall to the wayside.

Of course, our dedicated staff will check in on you each month if we notice you are falling behind, but why not take charge early and be your own boss from the start?

At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com), we know how rewarding and effective it can be to march to the beat of your own drum, which is why we have made providing quality, student-centred learning our top priority.
