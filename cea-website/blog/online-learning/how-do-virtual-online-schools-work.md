# How Do Virtual Online Schools Work?

While most people are still going to a brick-and-mortar school to get an education, there is a growing community of students who have started to get their education online. Once you step into this new type of learning atmosphere, you may find it suits your needs far better than a traditional approach. Virtual schools give you the opportunity to expand your horizons and pace yourself correctly as you make your way toward your diploma.

## How Online Schools Work

It is really quite simple to get started with an online education. Simply fill out the easy registration form and you will receive a welcome email directly from your teacher. You will be welcomed to the course and you can then start your studying at any time. You do not have to attend school during daytime hours -- you will have the freedom to choose your own schedule.

All of your lessons will be available online in the form of engaging presentations. These lessons are stimulating and contain real-life simulations, videos, and animations. Homework and quizzes are provided so that you can be sure that you are understanding all of the material.

Teachers are always available to offer support and can be contacted at any time. If you need help with a video presentation, project, essay, or any of the other assignments that may be required, please do not hesitate to get in touch with your teacher. At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/), we foster a nurturing and supportive environment for all of our students.
