# 5 Reasons You Should Consider Online Learning

Online schooling is very different from traditional schooling, so it is understandable if you are a little hesitant about making the switch. However, if you do decide to try online learning with us, you can rest easy knowing that our students love the online learning environment we provide. With certified teachers ready to provide feedback and assistance along the way, Canada e Academy is an online school inspected by the Ontario Ministry of Education, offering the same curriculum and quality of education as you would receive in a traditional brick-and-mortar school. Still not convinced? Keep reading to discover the top five reasons you should give online learning a try.

## 1. You Will Become the Boss of Your Own Learning

If you ask any of our students, they will agree that the greatest benefit of taking a course through us is the ability to work at your own pace and determine your own schedule. At Canada e Academy, we allow students to complete courses at an accelerated pace, but we also give students the option to take up to one full year to complete their course. This ability to work at your own pace encourages concept mastery and reduces test stress by allowing you to decide when you feel ready to complete assessments. It is also perfect for students with multiple commitments: with 24-hour access from anywhere in the world, our courses allow you to study when it suits you best, without fear of falling behind.

## 2. It Is Incredibly Flexible

At Canada e Academy, you determine where you study, when you study, and how long you study for, with very few limitations. This means that if you choose to take a course with us, you have the freedom to complete your work from wherever you feel most productive. With up to one full year to complete any of our courses, you should never feel rushed.

## 3. Individualised Learning Means No Peer Judgement

Traditional classrooms typically cater to the average student, leaving those at the top feeling under-stimulated while those who require more attention can fall through the cracks. With online schooling, each student works and studies at their own pace, with [instructors](https://canadaeacademy.com/about) available to provide one-on-one support as often as you need it, with no fear of judgement from peers. When you take away the social stigma of asking questions or receiving extra help, students who would otherwise struggle in silence reach out and receive the guidance they need to achieve the results they deserve.

## 4. Tackling a Tough Subject Online Improves Your Chance of Success

Although our online courses teach the same material as traditional day schools, our method of delivery and flexible pacing allow students to achieve greater success in even the most difficult of subjects. At Canada e Academy, we encourage students to master concepts before moving forward, and with unlimited playback on all our lessons, you have the ability to go over new concepts as many times as you need. Often, students will opt to save their toughest course until summer to allow them to really focus, without the added distraction of extracurriculars or the stress of a full course load.

## 5. If You Are More Introverted, Online Learning May Be Perfect for You

Does your lack of in-class participation drag your marks down? In an online environment, this is simply not a factor. Even for courses that include discussion board activities, students are given ample time to prepare their answers, which many introverts find highly beneficial as they are able to better organise their thoughts and carefully construct their responses before posting. Another benefit of online education for introverted learners is the freedom to attend class in a quiet, private location, which allows you to really focus on the material.

All things considered, online schooling offers benefits that simply cannot be found in traditional day schools. The transferable skills you develop along the way — from time management to self-discipline — will serve you well in post-secondary and beyond.
