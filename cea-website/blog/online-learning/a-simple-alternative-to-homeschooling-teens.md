# A Simple Alternative to Homeschooling Teens

Homeschooling has long been a popular choice for families seeking more control over their children's education. However, as students enter the high school years, homeschooling can become increasingly challenging. The curriculum becomes more specialised, post-secondary prerequisites need to be met, and parents may not have the expertise to teach subjects like advanced mathematics, chemistry, or physics.

This is where online school offers a compelling alternative.

## The Challenge of Homeschooling in High School

While homeschooling can work well for younger students, high school presents unique challenges:

- **Specialised subject matter:** Grade 11 and 12 courses require subject-specific expertise that many parents may not possess
- **Official credits:** Homeschooled students may not receive official Ontario credits unless registered with a school that can grant them
- **Post-secondary readiness:** Universities and colleges require specific course prerequisites that can be difficult to fulfil through informal homeschooling
- **Transcript recognition:** Without an official school transcript, the post-secondary application process can be more complicated

## How Online School Bridges the Gap

Online schools like [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/) provide many of the benefits that attract families to homeschooling -- flexibility, individualised pace, learning from home -- while also addressing the challenges that come with it.

**Ontario curriculum-aligned courses:** All courses at Canada e Academy are aligned with the Ontario curriculum, ensuring that students are learning the same material as their peers in traditional schools.

**Official credits:** As an inspected school, Canada e Academy can grant official Ontario credits that count toward the Ontario Secondary School Diploma and are recognised by colleges and universities.

**Qualified teachers:** Every course is taught by a qualified, Ontario Certified Teacher who provides feedback, support, and guidance throughout the learning process.

**Flexibility:** Students can study from home, on their own schedule, maintaining the flexibility that families value about homeschooling.

## Making the Transition

For families currently homeschooling, the transition to online school is typically smooth. Students are already accustomed to learning independently at home, which makes them well-suited for the self-paced model of online learning.

If your teen is approaching high school or is already in high school, and you are looking for a structured, officially recognised educational option that still allows for learning at home, [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/) may be the perfect fit. Contact our [guidance team](https://canadaeacademy.com/guidance) to discuss your options.
