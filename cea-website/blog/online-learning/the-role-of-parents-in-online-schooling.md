# The Role of Parents and Families in Online Schooling

As online learning continues to grow in popularity, more students and families are choosing this form of education. However, many families might be unsure of the role they can play in online learning. One of the main advantages of online learning is that parents can be more involved in the learning process. At the same time, online learning provides a valuable opportunity for students to learn and practise independence. These two aspects do not have to be contradictory; in fact, they can complement each other, depending on how parents and families engage in the process.

## Increased Access to Course Content

Although many schools strive to involve parents and families in the learning process, in-person instruction takes place away from the home and parental support, which can make involvement challenging. With online learning, parents can know exactly what their children are studying. At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com), parents can review any part of a lesson at any time. This accessibility means parents can help their children more thoroughly through one-on-one discussion, which is sometimes difficult in a crowded classroom. Families know their student best, and children may feel more comfortable asking questions of a parent than of a teacher.

## Collaboration with Teachers

Parents and students are encouraged to reach out to teachers at any time with questions or concerns. At Canada e Academy, students and parents can email teachers directly and expect a response within one business day. Being aware of the course content allows parents to better prepare for these discussions, helping them address their child's strengths and needs. This collaboration can ensure that all parties work together to provide the best possible education for the student.

## Monitoring Student Progress

It is common for students to seek their parents' help to review work before submission, and as long as it is not during tests or exams, it can be an effective strategy. Canada e Academy allows parents to have a Parent Portal so that they have complete access to their child's course and can monitor their progress. Since parents of online students can see exactly how far along their children are in any particular course, they can better help their children stay on track, both by ensuring schedules are kept and that students are consistently putting forward their best efforts.

## Fostering Independence

Despite the increased involvement parents can have in online learning, it is important to recognise when students are ready to work independently. Online education offers excellent opportunities for fostering independence. With the ability to review lessons at their own pace or connect with their teachers in their own words, students learn to rely more on their own skills — an essential part of their transition into adulthood. When parents observe their children working independently, encouraging this behaviour significantly benefits their long-term development.

Ultimately, online learning does not have to feel vastly different from traditional education for parents. It provides an easier way for them to support their children while also creating more opportunities for independence. Although the transition may seem daunting for families new to online education, they can seek further information by visiting our [information for parents](https://canadaeacademy.com/parents) page, or by [contacting](https://canadaeacademy.com/contact) Canada e Academy at any time.
