# Ontario's e-Learning Graduation Requirement: What You Need to Know

With the growing role of technology in everyday life, it is no surprise that online learning has become part of the Ontario education system. What was once an optional pathway is now a graduation requirement.

## The Requirement

Beginning with students who entered Grade 9 in the 2020-2021 school year, all Ontario students must earn two online learning credits as part of the requirements for an Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD). This requirement also applies to mature students entering the Ontario secondary school system.

The goal behind this requirement is to help students develop digital literacy and other important transferable skills that will benefit them in post-secondary education and the workforce.

## More Access to Courses

One significant benefit of online learning is gaining access to courses that may not be available at your day school. Whether you attend a small school with limited options or a larger school that simply does not offer the course you need, online learning can fill the gap.

At [Canada e Academy](https://canadaeacademy.com/), students can find courses that may be difficult to access elsewhere, including [Photography (AWQ4M)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/awq4m), [Kinesiology (PSK4U)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/psk4u), and [International Language](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses) courses. You can take these courses while still attending your full-time day school.

## Flexible Learning Options

Another significant benefit of online learning is the flexibility it offers. Whether you work part-time, have demanding extracurricular commitments, or find it difficult to keep up with the pace of a particular course, online learning can provide a solution.

At Canada e Academy, students learn at their own pace. Lessons are available any time, day or night, and there are no rigid due dates. Students can complete a course at a pace that suits their schedule and learning needs.

## Developing New Skills

One of the greatest benefits of fulfilling the e-learning requirement is the opportunity to develop new skills. In a world where digital proficiency is essential for success, online learning helps students build comfort with technology, digital communication, and self-directed work habits.

Students at Canada e Academy also benefit from virtual labs and simulations in courses such as [Science (SNC1W)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/snc1w) and [Mathematics (MTH1W)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/mth1w), gaining hands-on experience with tools that are increasingly used in post-secondary education and professional settings.

## Make the Most of the Requirement

Rather than viewing the e-learning requirement as just another box to tick, consider it an opportunity to:

- Take a course that interests you but is not available at your day school
- Get ahead by completing a credit during the summer or at your own pace
- Build valuable skills in self-discipline, time management, and digital literacy
- Explore a new subject area that could shape your post-secondary plans
