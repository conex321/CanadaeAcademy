# Pathway to the University of Waterloo

## About the University of Waterloo

The University of Waterloo is one of Canada's top innovation universities, located in Waterloo, Ontario. Founded in 1957, Waterloo is best known for operating the largest post-secondary co-operative education programme in the world, providing students with extensive paid work experience alongside their academic studies. The university has approximately 42,000 students and is consistently ranked among Canada's most innovative institutions.

Waterloo offers a wide range of programs across six faculties: Arts, Engineering, Environment, Health, Mathematics, and Science. The university is particularly renowned for its computer science, engineering, and mathematics programs, which are among the most competitive in the country. Waterloo's strong industry partnerships and entrepreneurial ecosystem -- including the Velocity incubator -- have produced more start-up founders than any other Canadian university.
