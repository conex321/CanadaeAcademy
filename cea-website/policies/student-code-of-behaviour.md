# Student Code of Behaviour

Canada e Academy is committed to maintaining a safe, respectful, and inclusive online learning environment. All students are expected to adhere to this code of behaviour throughout their enrolment.

Academic honesty is fundamental to the learning process. Students are expected to:

- Submit only their own original work
- Properly cite all sources and references
- Not copy, share, or distribute assessment materials
- Not use unauthorised aids during proctored evaluations
- Not misrepresent their identity or have someone else complete their work

**Consequences of academic dishonesty** may include a mark of zero on the assessment, a requirement to redo the assessment, or other disciplinary action as determined by the instructor and administration.
