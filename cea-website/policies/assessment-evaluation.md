# Assessment and Evaluation

Canada e Academy's assessment and evaluation policy is consistent with the Ontario Ministry of Education's *Growing Success* document. The primary purpose of assessment is to improve student learning.

---

## Policy Overview

Assessment is the process of gathering information that accurately reflects how well a student is achieving the curriculum expectations in a subject or course.

- **Assessment for learning:** Teachers provide students with descriptive feedback and coaching for improvement in future assessments.
- **Assessment as learning:** Teachers help students develop their capacity to be independent, self-directed learners who can set goals, monitor progress, determine next steps, and self-reflect.

Ongoing pre-assessments and formative assessments provide meaningful feedback on student progress. Summative assessments determine an overall grade in the course.

---

## Course Evaluation

The final mark for each course is divided into two parts:

| Component | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Coursework ("Term Work") | 70% | Cumulative evidence of summative evaluations throughout the course |
| Final Evaluation ("Final Summatives") | 30% | Summative evaluations in the final portion of the course |

Final summatives may or may not include an exam, depending on the individual course curriculum policy document. At the beginning of each course, students receive a course outline detailing the specific assessment and evaluation information.

---

## Achievement Categories

Student achievement is assessed across four categories, as defined by the Ontario curriculum:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Knowledge and Understanding | Subject-specific content and comprehension |
| Thinking and Inquiry | Critical and creative thinking, research and inquiry skills |
| Communication | Expression and organisation of ideas and information |
| Application | Use of knowledge and skills in familiar and new contexts |

---

## Withdrawing from a Course

- A withdrawal from a Grade 11 or 12 course **within** 5 days of the first report card being issued: the mark is **not** recorded on the Ontario Student Transcript (OST).
- A withdrawal from a Grade 11 or 12 course **after** 5 days of the first report card being issued: a "W" is entered in the "Credit" column, along with the mark at the time of withdrawal.
- Withdrawals from Grade 9 or 10 courses are never recorded on the OST.

---

## Repetition of a Course

When a course is repeated, only one course attempt earns credit toward the 30 credits required for the OSSD. In Grades 11 and 12, both courses are recorded on the OST, with an "R" appearing next to the session with the lower grade.

---

## Course Transfer Policy

A student enrolled in a course for less than 7 days who has not completed any assessment may request a transfer to another course at no additional cost. Each student receives one free course transfer. All transfer requests must be received within 7 days of initial enrolment. Decisions by Canada e Academy administration are final.

---

## Reporting Student Achievement

Canada e Academy uses the Provincial Report Card (Grades 9–12) for formal written reports, issued twice during the course:

1. **Mid-course report** — Reflects student achievement during the first reporting period and development of learning skills.
2. **Final report** — Reflects achievement for the entire course and development of learning skills.

---

## Learning Skills and Work Habits

Teachers assess the following learning skills throughout the course:

| Skill | Key Behaviours |
|-------|----------------|
| Responsibility | Fulfills commitments, completes work on time, takes responsibility for own behaviour |
| Organisation | Follows a plan, manages time, uses resources effectively |
| Independent Work | Monitors progress, uses time appropriately, follows instructions with minimal supervision |
| Collaboration | Works with others, shares information, resolves conflicts constructively |
| Initiative | Seeks new learning opportunities, demonstrates curiosity, takes positive risks |
| Self-Regulation | Sets goals, monitors progress, seeks help when needed, reflects on strengths and needs |

**Canada e Academy** is inspected by the Ontario Ministry of Education (BSID #665804).
