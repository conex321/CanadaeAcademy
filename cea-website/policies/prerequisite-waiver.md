# Prerequisite Waiver Request

Some Canada e Academy courses require completion of a specific prerequisite course before enrolment. If you do not have the listed prerequisite but believe you have equivalent knowledge or experience, you may request a prerequisite waiver.

You may need a prerequisite waiver if:

- You completed equivalent coursework at a school outside Ontario
- You are an international student whose credits do not directly map to Ontario course codes
- You are a mature student returning to education after time away
- You have relevant work experience or self-study in the subject area
