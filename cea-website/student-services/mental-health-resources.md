## Wellness Tips for Online Learners

### Set a Routine
Establish regular study times and stick to them. A consistent routine helps maintain focus and reduces stress.

### Take Breaks
Step away from your screen regularly. Short breaks improve concentration and reduce fatigue.

### Stay Connected
Online learning can feel isolating. Stay in touch with friends, family, and your Canada e Academy teacher. You are part of a learning community.

### Ask for Help
If you are feeling overwhelmed, reach out to your teacher, our guidance team, or student services. We are here to support you.

### Balance Your Schedule
You have flexibility — use it wisely. Do not try to rush through everything at once. A steady pace produces better results and less stress.
