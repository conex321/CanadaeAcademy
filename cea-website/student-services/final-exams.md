# Final Exams

All Canada e Academy courses have mandatory final summative evaluations worth 30% of your final grade. For many courses, this takes the form of a proctored exam. To maintain academic integrity, all final exams must be written in-person under the supervision of an approved proctor.

## Who Can Act as a Proctor?

A proctor is a professional adult of your choosing who is **not related to you**. Examples include:

- Day school teacher or guidance counsellor
- Librarian
- Doctor, lawyer, accountant, or other professional

The proctor must have a dedicated professional email address and access to a printer and scanner. They must agree to supervise you for the duration of the exam in accordance with Canada e Academy procedures.

## How Exams Are Scheduled

1. **Enter proctor details** — In the "Exam" tab of your course, enter your proctor's name, professional email address, and phone number at least 3 days before you wish to write.
2. **Proctor confirmation** — Your proctor receives an email and confirms their willingness to supervise.
3. **Teacher approval** — Your instructor reviews and approves the proctor.
4. **Schedule the exam** — You and your proctor mutually decide on the date, time, and location. Enter the date and time in the "Exam" tab.
5. **Write the exam** — Our system emails the exam and policy form to your proctor 2 hours before the scheduled time. You and the proctor proceed with the exam as scheduled.
6. **Submit** — After the exam, the proctor scans the completed exam and sends it back to your teacher as a clearly legible document.

## Important Notes

- In keeping with our self-paced model, **you choose the date and time** of your exam.
- The exam may be written at any location that is comfortable for you.
- If your proctor charges a fee for their services, Canada e Academy is not responsible for that fee.
- Some courses use a culminating project or alternative final summative instead of a traditional exam. Check your course outline for details.
