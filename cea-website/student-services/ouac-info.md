# OUAC Information

The Ontario Universities' Application Centre (OUAC) processes applications to Ontario's universities. As a Canada e Academy student, your marks are submitted directly to OUAC on your behalf.

## How It Works

1. **Create your OUAC account** and begin your application at [ouac.on.ca](https://www.ouac.on.ca).
2. **Add Canada e Academy** to the Academic Background section of your OUAC account.
3. **Request your marks** — When requesting your report card from Canada e Academy, check off "undergraduate."
4. **We submit your marks** — Canada e Academy sends your grades directly to OUAC. There is no charge for this service.

## 101 vs. 105 Applications

- **101 channel:** For current Ontario secondary school students. If you are earning your OSSD through Canada e Academy, you apply through the 101 channel.
- **105 channel:** For all other applicants, including international students who are not earning an OSSD.

As a Canada e Academy OSSD student, you benefit from applying through the 101 channel — the same application stream used by all Ontario high school students.
