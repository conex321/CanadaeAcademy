## Quebec Student Amelie Ducharme Expands Her Horizons with Canada e Academy

Did you know that Canada e Academy serves many students from outside of Ontario? Well, meet Amelie Ducharme! A student from Quebec who enrolled with Canada e Academy through an educational partnership. Amelie found that enrolling in a school outside her home province allowed her to improve her education, and reach her academic goals.

> "I recently graduated from CEGEP (part of our education system here, in Quebec) and got my DEC (Diploma of Collegial Studies) in Literature. I am now studying English and French Literature at McGill University in Montreal. Writing and reading are my passions, and I am grateful to have studied these subjects at Canada e Academy, which, I believe, has prepared me for higher education in English."

Amelie took two courses at Canada e Academy: Grade 10 English (ENG2D) and Grade 11 English (ENG3U).

> "I decided to take these courses because although the English programme at my French school was 'enriched', I wasn't challenged enough. My teacher noticed that I was bilingual and responsible, so she suggested I take this online course."

Though her teacher noted Amelie's sense of responsibility even before recommending her to Canada e Academy, Amelie feels that Canada e Academy helped encourage this trait and prepared her for her post-secondary education.

> "Canada e Academy prepared me for post-secondary by making me more organised and autonomous about my schedule and studies."

At the same time, Amelie felt that her classes allowed her to learn more than she would at her day school, by allowing her to immerse herself in English literature, giving her more experience with the language, and allowing her to practise her skills while indulging in classics that she would not have otherwise studied.

> "My favourite parts of learning with Canada e Academy? Not only the fact that I was able to choose my own pace of learning, but also that I was learning SO MUCH MORE than I was in my old English courses at my day school. I was able to study two great English literary classics -- Frankenstein and Macbeth -- something I never would have had the chance to do at my French school."

Given her experience with the programme, we asked Amelie if she had any advice for students interested in enrolling with Canada e Academy.

> "If you want to take online courses, the most crucial thing you need is organisation skills. If you don't take the time to do the course, it won't complete itself without you, and you will have to continue your studies throughout the summer -- so organising your time is really the key."

Canada e Academy is proud to have been a part of Amelie's academic journey, and we wish her the best of luck as she continues her education at McGill and beyond. Thank you, Amelie!
