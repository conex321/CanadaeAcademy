## Canada e Academy Graduate Becomes Kansas State Baseball Star

The life of an athlete is challenging. Not only must athletes continually train their bodies and work to improve their strategies, they must also balance these expectations with the responsibilities of regular life. For young athletes, this includes getting a good education. This is one of the key reasons why so many aspiring young athletes, like Raphael Pelletier, enrol with Canada e Academy.

As a Grade 12 student and elite baseball player, Raphael Pelletier -- like many young athletes -- found it difficult to balance his training with the demands of attending a day school on a regular schedule. In searching for alternatives, he discovered Canada e Academy, an online high school that allows students to create their own schedule and complete their high school studies entirely online — ideal for athletes who need flexible schooling options.

Among the many advantages of Canada e Academy's fully online programme is the ability to study from anywhere in the world. With this, Raphael was able to travel far and wide to games, practices and tryouts, without taking time away from school. And, with the custom-designed Learning Management System, all classes are pre-recorded, allowing students to watch them whenever they like, progressing through the course at their own pace, with OCT-certified teachers available to assist throughout the course via email.

> "Canada e Academy taught me to effectively manage my time between school, baseball and my personal life. It also helped me transition to university, where some of my courses have an online component."

As a full-time student with Canada e Academy, Raphael had his pick of elective offerings, such as International Business, Environment Resource Management, and Challenge and Change in Society, while earning his university-required credits like Grade 12 English and Advanced Functions. Upon completing all the requirements for the Ontario Secondary School Diploma, Raphael was issued his official diploma, without ever having to sacrifice his athletic training.

With this internationally recognised diploma under his belt, Raphael was accepted into Kansas State University, and was awarded a spot on their 2020 Fall Baseball Roster.

> Congratulations Raphael -- we wish you continued success in your bright future!
