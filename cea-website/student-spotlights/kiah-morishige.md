## A Q&A Interview with South African Student Kiah Morishige

Kiah Morishige is an international student with Canada e Academy, taking courses from her home country of South Africa. She needed to upgrade her math (MHF4U) and chemistry (SCH4U) marks in order to apply to post-secondary schools. However, having a physical disability also limited her options when it came to accessing traditional day school, but Canada e Academy gave her the opportunity to get a world-class education from the comfort of her own home.

**How do you feel Canada e Academy prepared you for the future?**

Having no definite deadlines for assignments/tests at Canada e Academy gives me the opportunity to practise my self-discipline and accountability in an academic environment that is common in university. The responsibility of the student in asking questions to consolidate coursework enables students to personally take responsibility for their education, a commonality in post-secondary education and in life.

**How did you find navigating our online portal?**

The fast feedback from teachers regarding coursework concerns as well as the video format of the lessons makes navigating this course easy. The best part for me is that the whole course is made available upfront, so completing coursework at your own pace is made possible.

**What would you say some of the biggest differences are between Canada e Academy and day school?**

Being online, Canada e Academy has some significant differences to your traditional day school. Formalities such as school uniforms, assemblies or school rules are nothing to worry about in a virtual and versatile environment. Quality of education and fair assessment takes precedence and you as the individual student are the priority.

**What would you say to someone thinking about studying online?**

If you are driven and have a good sense of self-awareness, online school is a fantastic way to access education. If your lifestyle or circumstances cannot be accommodated by day schools, Canada e Academy may be the solution you're looking for. Whether you are wanting to completely change school curriculums, take new courses because of a change in career interest or to upgrade your marks, online school through Canada e Academy can make your educational goals a reality.

All of us at Canada e Academy are happy to help Kiah continue to succeed in her academics.
