# Shanel Khan

**Canada e Academy Student**

---

Shanel has travelled and changed schools quite a bit in her life, due to her father's job. As you can imagine, changing schools isn't easy and switching between systems can disrupt your education. Now living in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Shanel is pursuing an International Baccalaureate, a universal diploma originally intended for students whose families move or travel frequently.

To help her with meeting the requirements for admission to IB, her day school counsellor recommended she take a particular course through Canada e Academy. Despite being based in Canada, the online format allows Shanel to earn her required credits from her current home in Saudi Arabia.

**What grade are you in and where are you currently studying?**

I'm in Grade 10 at American International School, Riyadh and will be starting my IB diploma next year. I am originally from Pakistan and have lived in many cities.

**What course are you taking with Canada e Academy?**

Grade 10 Principles of Mathematics, a required course for me to enter into the IB programme next year.

**What made you decide to study with Canada e Academy?**

I'm primarily taking this course to help complete my high school's requirements to allow me to take IB math next year. One of my counsellors at my school recommended it to me, as without this course, I would not have had a route to enrolling in IB because of my changing schools in the past. Because of my father's job, we have to change countries a lot. Without Canada e Academy helping me to catch up with requirements of my new school, I would have missed the opportunity of signing up for IB. This makes Canada e Academy very valuable for me.

**What are your favourite parts about studying with Canada e Academy?**

I really like how the teachers explain and how they make us understand in easy words. It is also divided in very small parts, so it helps me to completely understand a concept before moving forward.

**How does Canada e Academy compare to your previous school experiences?**

It's fun to learn with Canada e Academy and it's easier compared to face-to-face school. I also understand better compared to when I'm at my day school. You can work at your own pace and you don't have to worry about being left behind.

> Canada e Academy is an amazing experience and I really like it!
