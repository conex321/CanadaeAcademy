## Canada e Academy Helps Haoyu Earn Acceptance at Prestigious International Universities!

Like most high school students, Haoyu Liu was working hard to learn as much as possible during his senior years, with the hopes of earning acceptance to a prestigious university where he could follow his dreams. Unfortunately, Haoyu was having difficulties working with teachers in his regular day school. Every student learns differently, and sometimes a particular teacher's style may not match the way a given student learns, despite their being knowledgeable and motivated to do so.

Luckily, not long after Haoyu found himself in this unfortunately common situation, he discovered a school with a unique approach to learning -- Haoyu discovered Canada e Academy.

Shortly after making this discovery, Haoyu did some research into Canada e Academy's approach. He wanted to enrol somewhere where he would be able to take control of his own education. Canada e Academy's self-paced learning programme offered him just that -- while still maintaining the benefit of an OCT-certified teacher to answer questions as needed.

After careful research, Haoyu decided to take Grade 12 Advanced Functions and Calculus and Vectors with Canada e Academy. These were particularly important courses for his post-secondary goals, as he intended to major in Computer Science.

One thing Haoyu immediately appreciated was "the ease of the registration process," as well as the "ease of accessing the lessons, tests, and other resources right within the LMS." Haoyu also commends "the quality of Canada e Academy's lessons, both the videos and their narration."

Recently, Haoyu found that his hard work had paid off! He has been accepted to the University of Melbourne, where he is now studying Computer Science. We followed up with Haoyu to ask him what he thought of his experience, looking back on it from his current success. Here's what he had to say:

> "Canada e Academy helped me with achieving good grades, easily understand very difficult math concepts, and improve my learning skills majorly. I found that I was very well prepared for university, all thanks to Canada e Academy. Overall, Canada e Academy is much better at everything: teaching and supporting students reach their goals and I would definitely recommend it to everyone."

Thank you for your feedback Haoyu, and we wish you continued success in your post-secondary studies!
