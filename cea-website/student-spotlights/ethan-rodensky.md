**Canada e Academy Student**

## Meet Ethan Rodensky, Scholarship Recipient!

Ethan is currently pursuing an education in UI/UX design at George Brown College and hopes to secure a career in this field. Earlier this year, Ethan enrolled in MHF4U at Canada e Academy to brush up on the integral math skills any computer-related position requires. He was impressed with the overall student experience and with the custom-designed Learning Management System (LMS).

> "I found the course material well laid out, well organised, thoughtfully prepared and the instructions easy to follow."

Having a background in User Experience (UX), Ethan volunteered his time and expertise to provide valuable feedback. Ethan's insights, both as a student and as a UX enthusiast, have allowed further improvements to the student experience. And for Ethan, this allowed him to gain valuable first-hand experience working in his field.

> "My time working with Canada e Academy has given me real-world experience to put on my resume."

We are proud to award Ethan with a $500 academic scholarship to put towards his post-secondary studies. Thank you for your insights, Ethan, and best of luck to you as you pursue your dreams!
