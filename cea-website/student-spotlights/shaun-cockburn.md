# Shaun Cockburn

**Canada e Academy Student**

---

Shaun Cockburn is a high school senior from Venezuela. Despite living far from Canada e Academy's headquarters in Toronto, Canada, when Shaun was looking for alternative learning options, he decided to enrol with Canada e Academy, and since the school is entirely online, the distance wasn't a problem!

**What courses are you taking with Canada e Academy?**

I am currently taking Grade 12 Business and English courses, and intend to do four more soon.

**Why did you choose to enrol in courses with Canada e Academy?**

The biggest reasons I decided to take my courses here were the flexibility and because it was so easy to get in touch with teachers and support (from the admin team) when I need it most.

**What would you say is the most important skill you have learned with Canada e Academy so far?**

Since Canada e Academy is so flexible, a lot of the responsibility of getting work done is on myself. Therefore, Canada e Academy has helped me to be more responsible and has made me much better at time management, which are undoubtedly skills that I will carry with me after I finish here.

**How does your Canada e Academy learning experience compare to that of your day school experiences?**

At Canada e Academy, it was just so easy to learn and the flexibility made me much more comfortable, and that helped me to learn and absorb information better. When I was in day school I was constantly under stress and pressure and I didn't cope well with that, so I wasn't learning and I was unhappy with that. Canada e Academy was like an escape from all that -- it's a school but it didn't feel like one. It's just so much more fun to learn and do work now than it was back then.

**Do you have any advice for people who are considering online learning?**

The most important thing I would say is be disciplined and stick to a somewhat set schedule, even though it's flexible -- don't go too overboard and start slacking off.

**Would you recommend Canada e Academy to other students living abroad who are considering online learning?**

Yes! It is amazing. Joining Canada e Academy was probably one of the best decisions I have made. I have no regrets.
