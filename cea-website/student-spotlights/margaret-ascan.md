## Canadian Student Completing OSSD While Living Abroad

Margaret Ascan is a Canadian student living abroad in Europe. When her family first moved, she planned to attend an international school, however, she found that they had a substandard level of education. She decided it would be better for her to learn from a Canadian online school. She ultimately chose Canada e Academy because of the flexible schedules, over ten years of online teaching experience, and the positive reviews she read online. She completed 9th Grade with us and is now a 10th Grade student. She is currently enrolled in French (FSF2D) and Math (MPM2D).

**What were your favourite aspects of learning with Canada e Academy?**

The freedom to work at my own pace and schedule. As I'm preparing to complete my Grade 10 piano exam, the ability to work in increments throughout the day allows me to practise more between my mother's piano lessons. Thanks to Canada e Academy's flexible programme, my technique and musicality has flourished and advanced much faster in a year than I could have ever hoped for if I were attending traditional school.

This flexibility also allowed me to devote more time to my projects and give my best in all of my assignments. My deadline-free schedule gave me the time to complete in-depth research on interesting topics, gain new ideas, and create projects that truly meant something to me.

**How did your experience taking courses with Canada e Academy compare to your day school?**

When I was living in Canada, I was fortunate to attend very good schools, which instilled in me a curiosity and desire to learn more about the world. However, when I moved to Europe, the school I briefly attended was a disappointment in that it did not encourage students to strive for more than a passing grade. In comparison, the quality of education provided by Canada e Academy's resources, lessons, assignments, and teachers made online learning a very enjoyable experience. Despite the fact that I only communicated with my teachers via email, I felt they were always there to answer my questions, guide me through the course, and help me grow as a student as well as an individual.

**What advice would you share with students looking to take courses online?**

I would advise all students to find a school-life balance, especially if you plan to enrol full-time. I believe it is critical to contrast online school with other activities. Personally, I balanced my schoolwork and computer time with outdoor sports, piano, reading, and spending time with family and friends.

Here at Canada e Academy, we strive to help all our students succeed. Flexible and self-paced learning doesn't mean students are left entirely on their own. Our teachers monitor attendance patterns and will work with them to offer added support if they notice students are not progressing in their course. Our Student Success team is also available to aid students and even help them create study schedules if needed.

> "Learning at Canada e Academy has been a wonderful experience! The teachers are friendly and helpful, the courses are thoughtfully prepared and intellectually stimulating, and most importantly, Canada e Academy prepares its students for the responsible, independent work our lives will demand in the future!"
