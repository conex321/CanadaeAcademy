# Dongjun Cha

**Canada e Academy Graduate**

---

Dongjun Cha is a young student from Korea. After coming to Canada and studying at Robert Bateman Secondary School in British Columbia, Dongjun was set to graduate and move on to university. Unfortunately, he ran into an all-too-common problem: he realised he was missing a required course for acceptance into the university programme of his dreams! Luckily, Dongjun discovered Canada e Academy.

By enrolling with Canada e Academy, Dongjun was able to take the final class he needed at his own pace, which meant that instead of postponing his university goals by a semester, or even a full year, he was able to put in the work and complete the required credit quickly enough to move on with his programme admission as planned.

**What made you decide to enrol with Canada e Academy?**

I needed to take Grade 12 Calculus and Vectors so that I could get accepted by a university I want to go to.

**What did you find most helpful about the Canada e Academy experience?**

Canada e Academy has helped very much with my math. Not only did it do a great job teaching me calculus, but I also really liked the review unit that the course started with as it helped me brush up on my math skills before attempting the course.

**What are you doing now that you've graduated? Do you feel Canada e Academy helped to prepare you for your current activities?**

As I'm studying Computer Science, math was very important to me. Canada e Academy helped me a lot to prepare for the university!

**What were some of your favourite parts of your experience?**

I think Canada e Academy was very beneficial in that I could study any time and anywhere. I also liked the high-quality service that they provided. I could email my teacher and she would respond within a few hours. Also, when I emailed the office or contacted the guidance department, they would respond right away and helped me so much.

**Do you have any advice for people who may be considering online learning?**

I think if you need a credit or two, you should definitely take a course with Canada e Academy because it is an excellent online school. They have been around for more than a decade and they really know what they are doing.
