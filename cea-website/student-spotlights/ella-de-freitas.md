# Ella De Freitas

**Canada e Academy Student**

Although Canada e Academy is headquartered in Ontario and offers Ontario credits, the online nature of our courses means that students can take our courses and earn credits from anywhere in the world. Ella de Freitas is one of those students. Though currently living in Trinidad and Tobago, Ella intends to pursue her post-secondary studies in Canada. She realised that earning Ontario Secondary School credits could help her with that, so she decided to enrol with Canada e Academy.

**When did you start taking courses with Canada e Academy, and what courses are you taking?**

I recently joined Canada e Academy in February 2021. Right now, I am in Grade 9 and currently studying Geography and English.

**Why did you want or need to take online courses?**

I decided to start taking courses at Canada e Academy now as I would like to obtain my Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD) and go on to further my studies in Canada.

**Do you feel that Canada e Academy is helping to prepare you for post-secondary education?**

Canada e Academy is preparing me for post-secondary study by introducing me to a different way of teaching which encourages me to do research on my own and also teaching me how to present the information in a format that is more in line with post-secondary education.

**What are your favourite parts of learning with Canada e Academy?**

My favourite parts of learning with Canada e Academy are that I can go at my own pace, have the opportunity to go over lectures to ensure that I have taken all the information needed, and also work in my own time to complete assignments. The best part is having the flexibility to do my courses from anywhere, including the comfort of my home, once there is internet.

I live in Tobago, which is the sister island of Trinidad and located in the far-south eastern Caribbean. Studying at Canada e Academy has given me the opportunity to have the best of both worlds -- island life with quality education!

**What do you think of taking courses with Canada e Academy compared to your traditional school?**

From my experience so far, taking courses at Canada e Academy is far more efficient as I get a lot more work covered in a much shorter period of time. I currently do four hours daily of Canada e Academy as compared to seven hours of day school and feel that I have covered and learned way more, all from the comfort of my home.

**What advice would you give to students considering online learning?**

If I were to give advice to students looking to take courses online, it would be to ensure that you create a working space that has reliable internet connection with no distractions and try to set a schedule so that you have some routine to follow.

**Do you have anything else you would like to say?**

I just want to say thanks to the entire team at Canada e Academy for making online education this easy and accessible to everyone. I find Canada e Academy's model very interesting and enjoyable and look forward to continuing my education with the team.
