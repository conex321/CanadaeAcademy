**Canada e Academy Student**

## Q&A with Claire Park, from South Korea

Claire Park is a Grade 11 student from Seoul, South Korea. Claire has many dreams, including both athletics and academics. However, the global pandemic forced her to alter her plans, keeping her from the international travel required to attend her usual school in Collingwood, Ontario. Luckily, Claire found Canada e Academy. Though located far from her home in Seoul, Canada e Academy allowed her to continue with the Ontario curriculum, so she could return seamlessly to her usual Ontario school once circumstances allowed.

**What are you currently doing academically?**

I'm currently studying Grade 11 Financial Accounting (BAF3M) with Canada e Academy. It's a course I've been wanting to take for a while, therefore, I'm very excited to get deeper into the course!

I'm from Seoul, South Korea, but I'm currently attending the National Ski Academy in Collingwood, Ontario. However, due to the pandemic, I was forced to come back home to South Korea where I'm completing school virtually until returning to Collingwood.

**What factors influenced your decision to enrol with Canada e Academy?**

Canada e Academy has allowed me to take a course that has a link to the material I'm wanting to learn during my post-secondary years. Almost giving me the feeling of getting a step ahead and a step closer to post-secondary.

**What have been your favourite parts of your experience with Canada e Academy so far?**

The best thing that comes with learning with Canada e Academy is the flexibility you are given, perfect for students like me who are busy balancing school and sports. Considering the fact that Canada e Academy has students from all across Canada and some from around world, communicating with teachers is very easy. My teachers always respond when I need them.

I appreciate that the course structure enables me to learn at my own pace, and when I'm having a difficult time grasping the material, I can go over the units as many times as I need.

**Do you have any advice for people who may be considering online learning?**

With flexibility and freedom comes the importance of self-control and preventing procrastination. I advise students looking to take courses online to prepare themselves to build a schedule they can follow, for example, "completing a lesson per day" or a weekly goal of "completing three lessons a week."
