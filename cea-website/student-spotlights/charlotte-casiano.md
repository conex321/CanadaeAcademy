## An Interview with Charlotte Casiano, Full-Time Mom and Part-Time Student

Like so many, Charlotte Casiano decided to pursue a new career later in life, after years in the workforce and with young children to care for at home. With these responsibilities on her plate, Charlotte sought out a flexible solution that would allow her to pursue the career of her dreams, while still working and caring for her family. She found just that with Canada e Academy's self-paced model and wide range of courses. Charlotte has been steadily completing her prerequisite courses needed for her desired programme at Seneca College.

**What inspired you to resume your education?**

After high school, I was unsure of what I wanted to pursue for a career. I took a certificate programme as a pharmacy assistant/technician to work right away. After many years in the field, and with careful thought, I finally decided to change my career. As a full-time mom, working part-time, my growing family is what inspired me to improve on myself and pursue my education.

**What courses did you take at Canada e Academy and why did you decide to take them with us?**

I took ENG4U and MHF4U. I am also considering taking a couple more courses that are required for my desired post-secondary programme at Seneca.

**Do you feel that Canada e Academy prepared you for your future endeavours?**

I believe that Canada e Academy has definitely helped me get back into the routine of studying and time management while having the flexibility of taking care of my child and going to work.

**What would you say to a mature student in a similar situation who might be considering taking courses online?**

As a mature student, I would recommend taking the courses online because you have all the resources (interactive learning, slide shows, tests, projects and instructors) right in the comfort of your own home or wherever you decide to study (coffee shop, vacation, etc.) and on your own time -- provided that you are committed/motivated to complete the courses.

**How did your Canada e Academy experience align with your expectations of what e-learning would be like?**

I really enjoyed my experience with Canada e Academy. The experience I had with e-learning was better than my experience when I was in high school. The instructors are prompt with responding to questions or concerns with regards to homework or any course content in general. They lead you to the resources you need to help you get through the course.

**What were your favourite parts of learning with Canada e Academy?**

My favourite part was being able to control my studies and work on my own to get the courses done. I liked how interactive the slides were and some of the slides had short video clips that kept the courses fun and interesting.

**What are your academic/professional intentions in the near future?**

In the near future, I would like to pursue a career in either data science and analytics or accounting. Canada e Academy has all of the courses I need to help me become successful.
