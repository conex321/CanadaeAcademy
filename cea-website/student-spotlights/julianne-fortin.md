# Julianne Fortin

**Canada e Academy Graduate**

---

Julianne Fortin is a student athlete from Quebec. Like many young athletes, she dreamed of gaining admission to an elite sports school for university. Unfortunately, many of the programmes she was interested in were located in the United States, and due to differences between the education system in the US and in her home province of Quebec, gaining acceptance directly to a US university presented a big challenge. With that in mind, Julianne decided to enrol with Canada e Academy, so she could earn an Ontario Secondary School Diploma -- a diploma that was more widely accepted by universities.

**First off, what are you currently studying?**

I am presently doing my Grade 12 with Canada e Academy. I really enjoy it, because with COVID I can stay at home and it doesn't affect my studies. Canada e Academy is all set to do classes from home.

**What are your plans for after graduating from secondary school?**

My sport is Flag Football. I've been playing for almost five years now. I got recruited to continue to play Flag at Keiser University next year. It is the first year that Flag Football is a university sport in the United States, so I'm excited to see how much it will continue to grow.

**What courses are you currently taking with Canada e Academy?**

English, Calculus and Vectors, Biology, Physics, Advanced Functions, the Ontario Literacy Course, International Business, and Chemistry.

**Why did you decide to enrol with Canada e Academy?**

I wanted to complete Grade 12, which is not accessible in Quebec. This would give me easier access to universities in the United States.

**Do you feel Canada e Academy has helped to prepare you for university?**

Canada e Academy prepared me in many ways. I learned how to plan my schedule (courses and exams) and how to take notes on my own. I also learned how to assimilate the different subjects on my own and to reach out when I needed help.

**What were your favourite parts of your experience with Canada e Academy?**

I really enjoyed planning my exams and my schedule on my own. There are no specific deadlines, so it gives you that liberty. I also really enjoyed the proximity we had with the teachers. All our homework and exams are corrected within two days, and we always have positive feedback with our grade. Another part that I really enjoyed is that we were learning at our own rhythm. The courses are clear and detailed.

**How did your experience with Canada e Academy compare with your experience at your day school?**

For me, it was really similar. The teachers are as reachable, if not even more, than any day school teacher. The workload is similar. The main difference to me is that with Canada e Academy we can learn at our own rhythm, compared to day school where you follow the class's rhythm.

**Do you have any advice for students interested in online learning?**

Make sure that you are an organised student that has self-discipline because it is easy to get distracted.
