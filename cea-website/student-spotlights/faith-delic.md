# Faith Delic

**Canada e Academy Graduate**

---

Faith is a former Canada e Academy graduate who is currently studying Physics and Philosophy at King's College in London, England.

Faith came to Canada e Academy from a homeschooling background, before completing Grade 11 and 12 with us in order to earn her Ontario Secondary School Diploma.

## Why Did You Choose Canada e Academy?

For the last ten years, my family and I have worked in Zambia, Africa with an NGO that builds schools for orphans and vulnerable children. Such a shift in our lives left us wondering how I could achieve my OSSD while living abroad. My mom heard about Canada e Academy from a friend and enrolled me in their programme. I was so thankful to find a programme that could grant me my OSSD despite my unique living situation. The fact that I could access my lessons and submit my evaluations any time I wanted was extremely helpful for me since I lived in a country six hours ahead of Toronto time. Canada e Academy allowed me to finish high school with lessons that challenged me and a programme that allowed me to achieve my post-secondary dreams.

## What Courses Did You Take?

**Grade 11:** Physics (SPH3U), Math (MCR3U), Chemistry (SCH3U)

**Grade 12:** English (ENG4U), Writer's Craft (EWC4U), Advanced Functions (MHF4U), Calculus and Vectors (MCV4U), Chemistry (SCH4U), Physics (SPH4U), Nutrition and Health (HFA4U)

## How Has Canada e Academy Prepared You For Life Outside of High School?

I believe that Canada e Academy taught me the valuable lessons of self-discipline and independent research. As I head to university, these lessons are invaluable since university life revolves around those concepts as you have to push yourself to learn and grow in that setting.

## What Were Your Most Memorable Parts of Learning With Canada e Academy?

- The timely teacher responses to emails
- The timely feedback/marks to tests and assignments
- Overall student support from teachers and administration
- Ease of use of the LMS (accessing the lessons, the tests, the teaching resources, etc.)

## What Advice Would You Share With Students Who May Be Looking to Take Courses Outside of Their Day School?

I highly recommend the online learning platform found in Canada e Academy as it allows you to learn lessons of self-discipline and independence which will be able to take you far in life regardless of whether or not you choose to do post-secondary education. In addition, if you have a lifestyle that requires flexible deadlines, Canada e Academy is the right programme for you.
