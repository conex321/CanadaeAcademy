## Canada e Academy Allows Out-of-Province Student Lucy Baxter to Take the Courses She Needs

Lucy Baxter wanted to study French Immersion (FIF2D), but her day school didn't offer it as a possibility. She lives in the Yukon and there aren't a lot of options; many of the school boards are cancelling their French Immersion programmes. She was happy to see that Canada e Academy offered the courses she needed, and that she was able to enrol with us as an out-of-province student.

**What was your favourite part about studying with Canada e Academy?**

Learning at my own pace and not having to go to classes were my two favourite aspects of learning with Canada e Academy. The videos and explanations for each assignment are very well done and helpful. The teachers and support staff are also very helpful and respond quickly. I felt like I had complete control of my learning. I could decide when I wanted to do a lesson, how many lessons in a day, when I wanted to hand in an assignment or even when I wanted to do a test, all on my own time. Online school is more relaxed and I'm not as stressed to get everything done. I am able to perform to my best abilities as I am working at my own pace.

**How has Canada e Academy helped you prepare for your future?**

It has helped me to be self-disciplined and focus on my time management because I'm doing this course mostly independently but I appreciated the teacher's help whenever I needed it.

**Do you have any advice to others thinking about taking a course with Canada e Academy?**

My advice is that you need to make sure you stay on top of your work and don't leave it all to the end. I think online school only works if you are self-disciplined, which is a great skill to develop.

Here at Canada e Academy we are happy that we could help Lucy get the courses she needs to succeed.
