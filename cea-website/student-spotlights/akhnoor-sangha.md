# Akhnoor Sangha

**Canada e Academy Graduate**

---

There are many reasons why students choose to enrol with Canada e Academy. For Akhnoor Sangha, who started high school in 2019 at the age of 15, a year later than most students, she was searching for a school that would allow her to fast-track her studies. With Canada e Academy's flexible model, Akhnoor was able to do just this!

Fresh off completing her final batch of courses required for the OSSD, we asked Akhnoor to share a bit about her experience as a full-time student with Canada e Academy.

**Why did you decide to complete your OSSD through Canada e Academy?**

I decided to complete my OSSD through Canada e Academy because I could finish school at a flexible pace. I liked how I could go through a lesson as many times as I wanted and complete my assignments in the time I wanted. Canada e Academy fulfilled my needs.

**As a full-time student, how many courses did you prefer to work on at a time?**

I enjoyed the freedom and the flexibility to study any of my courses at any time. Personally, I liked to focus on a few courses at a time to finish the course quickly and to ensure focus on each course wisely.

**What were your favourite parts of learning with Canada e Academy?**

The feedback they gave me at the end of the assignments was extremely helpful. It helped me to figure out the teacher's expectations of my work, and it drastically improved the quality of my assignments. Also, the staff! They were welcoming and friendly. My guidance counsellor was really helpful and helped me every bit of the way.

**How did your Canada e Academy experience compare to your previous day school experience?**

The staff is so welcoming; they had a huge impact on my study decisions. When I was in day school, my marks were average and when I came to Canada e Academy my marks changed drastically. I also suffered no bullying and had the time to do other things in my life that never seemed a priority to me but now do.

**What advice would you share with students looking to take courses online?**

1. Take a few courses at a time so you can focus all you want on those courses.
2. Take as many notes as possible because they will help you in preparing for a test and the exam.
3. Don't take things too lightly because the exams are often challenging.
4. If you don't understand a topic, feel free to email your teachers because they will mostly help you with anything.
5. Last and most important: keep going and you can do this!

**What are your academic/professional intentions in the near future?**

I am most likely going to pursue my career in business as a full-time real estate agent. I will be applying to York University and Guelph-Humber University because of the great business curriculum and teaching faculty there.

> I am happy a school like Canada e Academy came into my life and helped me become the person I am today. I am honoured to have been their student for my high school experience. THANK YOU CANADA e ACADEMY!!!
