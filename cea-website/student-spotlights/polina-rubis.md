# Polina Rubis

**Canada e Academy Student**

---

At Canada e Academy, we are very proud to be able to help students from all over the world. Thanks to our online format and Ministry-inspected status, we are able to teach the Ontario curriculum -- and issue official OSSD credits and diplomas -- to students within Ontario, elsewhere in Canada, or anywhere in the world they may be!

Recently, we chatted with Polina Rubis about her experience with Canada e Academy and how this ability to study remotely has benefitted her pursuit of the OSSD. Here's what she had to say!

**First off, Polina, where are you studying from?**

I was born and originally studied from the Ukraine, but now I'm studying in Nova Scotia, Canada.

**What are you currently doing, and what are your plans after graduating?**

I'm currently a Grade 12 student with Canada e Academy, but I am preparing myself to become a film director.

**Why did you want or need to take an online course?**

I wanted to overcome troubles with math anxiety, and I needed a self-paced format for learning science.

**What courses did you take or are you taking with Canada e Academy?**

I am now taking Philosophy, Theatre, and English. These courses will help me in my post-secondary pursuits in film studies.

**What did you like about Canada e Academy and what were your favourite parts of online learning?**

I love how it's understandable and informative, and that I can reach out to the teacher any time I don't understand something. I thank the staff of Canada e Academy as they have helped me to get excited to start my journey. The material is explained in a much smaller period of time than in school. Also, I can plan my own day, spending more time with my hobbies. I prefer doing my hobbies during the day and doing my learning at night, and Canada e Academy was perfect for this.

**What advice would you give to students thinking about enrolling with Canada e Academy?**

I would say to try an online course with Canada e Academy, and then if you like it as much as I did, you will end up taking more courses, or even graduating with Canada e Academy... like I am! I am now planning to graduate with Canada e Academy, as it gives me more time with my parents before I go off to film school.
