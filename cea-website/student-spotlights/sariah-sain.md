# Sariah Sain

Sariah is a competitive swimmer located in Costa Rica. She decided to complete her high school education with Canada e Academy so that she could have the flexible study schedule she needs in order to continue her training.

She is currently enrolled in Grade 11 University English (ENG3U) and Grade 12 International Business Fundamentals (BBB4M) with Canada e Academy, with plans to enroll in more. She chose these two subjects to start with in part because she wants to build her English language skills. Her first language is Spanish, with German and English as her second languages. By taking university level English with Canada e Academy, she can be prepared for attending college in the future. She also plans on focusing on business for her post-secondary studies, so taking International Business with Canada e Academy felt like it would be a good stepping stone to get started.

We asked Sariah a few questions regarding her enrollment with Canada e Academy so far.

## What are your favourite parts of learning with Canada e Academy?

My favorite part is knowing that I have control of my time. Since I am a swimmer and I have a crazy schedule, to have the possibility to learn in my own time has been so beneficial to me. Also learning at my own rhythm, without rushing, is great for me, since I can take my time to understand a subject.

## How did your experience taking courses with Canada e Academy compare to your day school?

My experience compared to my day school has been so stress relieving, since I don't feel any type of pressure with time.

For me what I needed the most was time, so I can work around my training schedule. Of course, day school also has great advantages as socializing, but I feel I have already done that part, and now I want to feel the experience of working on my own, so I can learn to handle my own time, and the experience has been more than great. I really like how organized Canada e Academy is with the material of each subject, and how easy it is to understand.

## What advice would you share with students looking to take courses online?

I recommend it 100% to students that are into athletics, or students that want to achieve other activities in their life, but don't have the time in regular school. Taking courses online has many advantages, such as helping you to prepare for college, just by learning how to study on your own. It's a great preparation for that and for life.

Canada e Academy has been the best choice I have made. I find it perfect for what I need in my life right now, and will help prepare me for what's to come. I want to add that the studying material that has been given to me is very well explained and designed. The teachers have been very helpful and answer my questions very clearly. I must say Canada e Academy has gone beyond my expectations.
