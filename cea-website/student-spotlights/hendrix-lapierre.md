## 2020 First Round NHL Draft Pick and Canada e Academy Graduate

If you haven't heard of Hendrix Lapierre yet, chances are you will soon! Anyone who followed the 2020 NHL Draft may be familiar with him already: he was the Washington Capitals' first round pick.

Here at Canada e Academy, we have been following Hendrix's journey for quite some time. In fact, being drafted into the NHL wasn't Hendrix's only accomplishment of 2020: he also became one of our recipients of the Ontario Secondary School Diploma!

Much like earning your high school diploma, becoming a first-round draft pick doesn't happen overnight, nor without a great deal of hard work and dedication. Lapierre has been a member and top prospect of the Chicoutimi Sagueneens of the QMJHL since 2018. After several discussions regarding his post-secondary plans with both his agent and family, Hendrix decided to enroll in a full-time curriculum with Canada e Academy.

Without the time constraints of a traditional school schedule, Hendrix was able to pursue his studies in French, English Literature (ENG4U), History (CHY4U), Business (BBB4M), and more, while on the road with the Sagueneens. With Canada e Academy's fully online platform, Lapierre's education was literally in the palm of his hand -- accessible through the device of his choosing. And, with Canada e Academy's self-paced model, there were no prescribed class times, no due dates, and no "filler" assignments to pass the time -- just the material he needed to learn, interactive multimedia lessons, and access to an OCT-certified teacher to help whenever he needed. With this high degree of freedom and flexibility, Lapierre was able to maintain a high academic average, while performing at an elite level on the ice. In addition to being drafted first-round, Hendrix has also been accepted to Algonquin College for studies in Nutrition and Communication.

> Canada e Academy is incredibly proud of Hendrix and looks forward to watching his future success. We've witnessed first-hand his diligence, discipline, and determination, and know that these skills and devotion will take him to incredible heights. Best of luck, both on the ice and off, Hendrix!
