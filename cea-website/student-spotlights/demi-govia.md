## Demi Govia Turns to Canada e Academy to Improve Her Pandemic Learning Experience

Demi Govia was, like millions of students around the world, thrust into online learning due to COVID-19. As schools rushed to switch to an online format, many turned to live-meeting programmes like Zoom. Unfortunately, Demi felt that the e-learning experience provided by her local school in Trinidad and Tobago was not effective for her style of learning.

> "The online Zoom calls for schools down here were too hard to learn. They were not convenient, as you had to be online at a specific time, and we are not able to watch the lessons over again."

Luckily, Demi discovered Canada e Academy. The self-paced, asynchronous format appealed to Demi more than her day school's model, and since the programming is fully online, she was able to register and work on her courses from the comfort of her home in Trinidad and Tobago.

> "I thought finding a Canadian online school would be great for my education, and would make it easier to get into colleges in the future. And I was not wrong, Canada e Academy has been amazing!"

With Canada e Academy's unique Learning Management System, students are able to view all lessons and materials at any time, including pausing, rewinding, and re-watching lessons whenever they like.

But that isn't the only advantage that Demi found. Canadian post-secondary institutions are well-respected around the world, and graduating from a Ministry-inspected school, like Canada e Academy, gives students easier access to these prestigious institutions.

> "I want to study to work with special-needs children, such as those with Down syndrome or autism, because I have a little sister who has Down syndrome. Right now, that's what I am thinking of studying."

For now, Demi is starting off with two courses, Grade 9 English and Geography, but plans to take more in the future. She notes how the self-guided nature of the programming is helping her form more independent study habits.

> "The independent work has prepared me to be more responsible and organised."

> "I really like that Canada e Academy gives you the amount of time you need to hand in your work. You can take your time."

After seeing her preliminary work ethic, we know that Demi is well on her way to achieving her academic goals, and we're very proud to play a part in another exceptional student's educational journey towards success!
