## Canadian Paralympic Swimmer Completes Final Credit Online

My name is Abi, and I am a member of the Canadian National Swimming Team. I represented Canada at the Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, and prepared for the Paralympic Games in Tokyo as well.

I graduated from my regular high school in June of 2019. I had planned to graduate with my peers and have the 2020 season open for training towards the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics. However, at graduation, I was missing a 4U credit to be eligible to apply to university. At the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown in Ontario, I was out of training and saw the uninterrupted time at home as ideal for completing the final credit I required.

Canada e Academy became the ideal place to take Writer's Craft 4U (EWC4U). I have done online courses through my day school and with other online high schools. Still, Canada e Academy's flexible schedule, interactive course lessons, and competitive course fees were what made the decision easy to commit to studying here.

The Writer's Craft course was enjoyable with Canada e Academy. I felt like I got the support and feedback I needed to improve my writing style and communication. Before starting the course, I had never pursued poetry or dramatic writing, but the course content and my teacher inspired me to explore that genre more fully.

My favourite part of learning with Canada e Academy was the freedom to follow my schedule. I never needed to stress while getting an assignment done. I could balance training and school at the same time, without feeling the pressure to be doing one or the other.

The e-learning experience was one of the best I have experienced. Having the lessons in a presentation format with an audio recording to go in-depth for each slide was very similar to what I would experience in my day school -- just from home. For me, being able to watch each slide at my own pace and listen multiple times helped me gain a deeper understanding of the content.

For anyone interested in e-learning courses, know that you will need to motivate yourself to complete the content. I recommend that students create a sustainable routine to help them stay engaged and on track with the course.

In the fall, I began my studies in psychology at Universite Laval in Quebec City. I am thankful for my deeper understanding of the English language structure, so I can now focus on mastering French grammar.
