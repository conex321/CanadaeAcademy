# Khaled Alasmar

**Canada e Academy Student**

---

Meet Khaled, an ambitious young man who dreamed of enrolling in a business management programme at a top university. His goal? To work his way into one of the many lucrative and fulfilling career opportunities that such a programme would bring.

With this goal in mind, he knew that his education would be incredibly important to his future. As such, his family wanted to ensure he had the best education possible, and to them, that meant studying within the Canadian education system.

The only problem? They live in Egypt, not Canada. However, when the time came to move on to high school, Khaled could not find an Egyptian high school that offered a Canadian secondary school curriculum. Being comfortable with the Canadian curriculum, he did not want to suddenly shift to his local school system.

Luckily, Khaled discovered he could continue his Canadian education from his home in Egypt by studying online with Canada e Academy.

> "I started elementary school with a Canadian education, so I wanted to continue with a similar curriculum while in Egypt. None of the schools near me have a Canadian curriculum. Canada e Academy allows me to live at home in Egypt and earn a Canadian high school diploma!"

With his previous studies in Egypt, Khaled was granted equivalent credits for Grades 9 through 11. Then, with advice from Canada e Academy's guidance team, he registered for six Grade 12 courses, to ensure he would have a strong "top six" with which he could apply to any post-secondary school of his choosing.

Canada e Academy's wide range of available courses allowed him to enrol in the required courses of his programme, like University-level English and Advanced Maths, while also taking programme-specific electives like Economics, Politics, and Business.

> "Studying with Canada e Academy helped me increase my chances of getting accepted into universities because of the potential Canadian high school diploma status -- this is a huge advantage for me."

Once Khaled began his courses, he found many advantages to this new learning format.

> "Being able to do lessons and finish anything whenever I wanted. That was a major upside for me because it relieved a good amount of potential stress. Another part I enjoyed was the content and the ease of understanding the lessons. The teachers are amazing. Very helpful and supportive."

Canada e Academy is proud to have played a part in helping Khaled, and students like him from around the world, find the academic success we believe all students deserve.

> We wish you all the best in your continued studies, Khaled!
