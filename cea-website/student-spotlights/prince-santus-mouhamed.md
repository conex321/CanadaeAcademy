# Prince Santus Mouhamed

**Canada e Academy Student**

---

Prince Santus Mouhamed is a young man from Cameroon who is highly interested in planning for his future. As graduation neared, he wanted to ensure he was taking every route possible to guarantee himself the best chance of acceptance in the university programmes of his choosing. That's why Prince decided to enrol with Canada e Academy!

By graduating with Canada e Academy, he will be earning an Ontario Secondary School Diploma -- a diploma that is well respected by post-secondary institutions around the world, thereby boosting his odds of acceptance.

Of course, under traditional circumstances, the fact that Prince lives and studies in Cameroon, West Africa would prevent him from enrolling in an Ontario-based school. Fortunately, because of Canada e Academy's fully online format, Prince has been able to continue his pursuit of the OSSD from the comfort of his own home -- some 10,000 kilometres away!

**What courses have you taken with Canada e Academy?**

English, Advanced Functions, Chemistry, Physics, Calculus and Vectors, and Nutrition and Health.

**Why did you decide to enrol with Canada e Academy?**

I was advised by my home school. It was presented to me to take these courses with Canada e Academy so that I may earn an OSSD, a worldwide-recognised high school diploma that will enable me to apply to any university or college around the world. And the best part is I can do this from my own home in Cameroon!

**Do you feel Canada e Academy has helped you improve any skills beyond the regular course material?**

Canada e Academy has improved my online study skills, my independent and critical thinking, and my time management and organisational skills.

**What have been some of your favourite parts of your experience?**

Evaluations, submissions, lesson content, and the quick replies from the teachers all contribute to an amazing online experience.

**Do you feel Canada e Academy has helped to prepare you for college or university?**

Taking courses at Canada e Academy has made me more mature and able to work autonomously. It's amazing to think that I am learning in a Canadian school in Cameroon.

**Do you have any advice for people who may be considering online learning?**

I would advise them to register and be prepared to work hard just like in day school, take personal initiatives, and look for a reliable school like Canada e Academy.

Prince is currently wrapping up his final few courses and is on track to graduate! We wish you all the best, Prince!
