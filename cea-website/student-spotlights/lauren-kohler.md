# Lauren Kohler

**Canada e Academy Student**

---

Lauren Kohler is a part-time student with Canada e Academy, who completed Grade 11 Biology (SBI3U) and is currently taking Grade 12 Biology (SBI4U).

She decided to take Biology with Canada e Academy because she wasn't able to take it with her regular day school. Many of the university programmes she was looking at required her to have at least two science courses. Since her day school didn't allow her to take more than one science course at a time, she decided to sign up with Canada e Academy and complete the extra course over the summer.

**How has Canada e Academy prepared you for post-secondary?**

Canada e Academy allowed me to work independently, which was helpful for many reasons. It taught me how to independently learn and figure things out using several resources, which is helpful for post-secondary as it's a crucial life skill to be independent. The asynchronous format also taught me how to create my own schedule and learn to not procrastinate.

**What were your favourite parts of learning with Canada e Academy?**

My favourite part about learning with Canada e Academy was how fast the teachers marked assignments and responded to emails, and how I was able to work at my own pace. The teachers marked quite fairly and if I ever had a question, I was never concerned about not receiving a response in time.

**How did your experience taking courses with Canada e Academy compare to your day school?**

My experience with Canada e Academy was really different in comparison with my day school routine. I was able to work at my own pace, meaning I didn't feel rushed to complete certain assignments by certain deadlines. Working asynchronously during the summertime also allowed me to work a summer job. I would work my 9-5 during the day and would work on my assignments and lessons when I got home and on weekends.

**What advice would you share with students looking to take courses online?**

I would advise others to lay out a planned schedule when first starting the course, with when they are planning on completing assignments and tests. Ensure that you do a few lessons each day as opposed to cramming everything in at the last minute.

Lauren is currently in Grade 12 studying in an International Baccalaureate Programme. We wish Lauren the best of luck with all her future academics and are very happy to be a part of her educational journey.
