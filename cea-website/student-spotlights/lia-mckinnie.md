# Lia McKinnie

Lia McKinnie recently graduated from Canada e Academy. She chose Canada e Academy because she wanted to take control of her education and work at her own pace so she could fast-track high school, all while having a flexible schedule that allowed her time for competitive athletics and a part-time job. We asked Lia to answer a few questions about her time with Canada e Academy.

**What course(s) did you take at Canada e Academy?**

I took 18 courses at Canada e Academy, including academic Math and Science courses, as well as creative subjects such as Art and Communications Technology.

**How has Canada e Academy prepared you for life outside of high school?**

Canada e Academy has prepared me for life outside of high school by teaching me crucial skills I would not have learned at a traditional high school. The student-led learning at Canada e Academy taught me how to manage my time, focus outside of a classroom setting, and keep myself accountable to meet deadlines even when there were no external consequences.

**How did your experience taking courses with Canada e Academy compare to your day school experience?**

The experience at Canada e Academy is very different compared to my experience at a traditional day school. Taking courses at Canada e Academy made school much more enjoyable because I could work at my own pace, whenever I wanted, wherever I needed to. Due to the independent nature of Canada e Academy, students can complete courses in much less time than in a traditional school setting. This allowed me the flexibility to work and train 20 hours a week without becoming overwhelmed and while staying on track with my schoolwork.

**What advice would you share with students who may be looking to take courses outside of their day schools?**

I have one piece of advice for students who are looking to take courses outside of their day schools: make a plan. One of the most challenging aspects of student-led learning is the lack of external deadlines and consequences. By creating a plan for yourself and sharing it with your friends and family, you will be more likely to stay on track because you have a clear outline of what needs to be done when, and you have people to help you stay on track.

Currently Lia is taking a gap year to travel, volunteer, and focus on her athletic career. Next year she plans to attend Franklin University in Switzerland to study Social Justice and Sustainability.
