# Owen Butler

Owen Butler is a student athlete who balanced hockey training alongside his high school courses. He graduated from Canada e Academy in May 2025 and will be attending the University of Waterloo -- Business Administration (Laurier) and Mathematics (Waterloo) Double Degree (Co-op only) this fall.

We asked Owen a few questions about his time with Canada e Academy.

## What courses did you take with Canada e Academy?

Calculus (MCV4U), Advanced Functions (MHF4U), Data Management (MDM4U), Computer Science (ICS3U and ICS4U), English (ENG4U), Physics (SPH4U).

## How has Canada e Academy prepared you for life outside of high school?

Canada e Academy has taught me time management skills that are transferable to every day life. They have also taught me self-discipline given it is an online institution and I work at my own pace. I had to be disciplined in making sure I managed my time accordingly to balance a busy schedule and graduate on time.

## What were your most memorable parts of learning with Canada e Academy?

- The quality lessons, including the videos and narration
- The timely teacher responses to emails
- The timely feedback/marks to tests and assignments
- Overall student support from teachers and administration
- Ease of use of the LMS (accessing the lessons, the tests, the teaching resources etc)
- Ease of the registration process

## How did your experience with Canada e Academy compare to your day school experience?

My experience with Canada e Academy was completely different from day school because I am a fast learner and so I was able to progress through class much quicker than I would have been able to in day school.

## What advice would you share with students who may be looking to take courses outside of their day schools?

I would tell them to enroll with Canada e Academy and to have a plan. Scheduling out your classes and putting aside time to work will help a ton and keep you on track. That way you have a benchmark on if you're ahead or not.
