# Anna Turkington

**Canada e Academy Graduate**

---

Anna Turkington graduated with Canada e Academy in June 2024, earning her OSSD with high marks in all of her courses.

Since then, Anna has been busy pursuing her career in professional ballet. Currently, she is working with a Toronto-based company called Ballet Jorgen as an apprentice. She has danced in over 50 performances including Anne of Green Gables the Ballet, The Nutcracker, and Sleeping Beauty.

> "I will be returning to the company in August as a full company dancer and I'm very grateful for all that being a dancer there has brought. I have been working towards the goal of being a company dancer since I was five, and Canada e Academy played a vital role in helping me achieve this dream."

Meet Anna Turkington, an award-winning competitive ballerina and a full-time student with Canada e Academy. We asked Anna to answer some questions about how online learning fit into her day-to-day life as a professional dancer.

**First off, tell us a bit about yourself!**

I am a Canadian-born professional ballet dancer currently living and dancing in Pennsylvania, USA. Prior to sticking with ballet full-time, I trained in other styles of dance including contemporary, jazz, tap, hip-hop, lyrical, musical theatre, and modern. For a time, I also specialised in acrobatics with intentions of joining the world of Cirque Du Soleil. However, for the past few years, I have been training professionally at the world-renowned Rock School for Dance Education in Philadelphia. Since joining that school, I have had numerous opportunities to dance alongside many influential people in the industry on some of the most prestigious stages in performances and competitions. I am humbled and honoured to say that I have won first place in the Junior Division at Youth American Grand Prix three years in a row and competed in their New York City Finals, where I internationally placed top twelve.

**Why did you decide to complete your OSSD through Canada e Academy?**

Training full-time in any sport or extracurricular activity does not allow for much flexibility. For me, I have six -- sometimes seven -- full days of ballet training each week. Through Canada e Academy, I have the freedom to complete schoolwork at my own pace, at any time throughout the day (or night). There are days where I only have a small window to complete schoolwork in between dance classes and some days where I have performances and competitions and don't have a chance to do schoolwork. Then, there are days where I have a block of time to accomplish as much schoolwork as possible to make up for lost time -- something that wouldn't be attainable at a brick-and-mortar school.

**How has your experience so far aligned with your expectations of what e-learning would be like?**

After switching to online (especially with Canada e Academy) I will likely not return to a regular school ever again. There is a lot of wasted time at school that is not present during e-learning, meaning more work can be achieved in a shorter time frame and at a schedule tailored to you.

**What aspects of the Canada e Academy learning model stand out to you?**

I think my favourite aspect of the courses is the level of interaction between the teacher and student. Some other online schools I've attended just used documents of information to learn and study off of. I find it is much easier to absorb information when there is a "physical" teacher describing the concepts. I also like having a short quiz at the end of each lesson to enforce what was just taught.

**How do you maintain balance between your academic and professional pursuits?**

Maintaining the balance between academic work, having somewhat of a social life, the demands of ballet training, and making time for alternative activities can definitely be tricky. I have found that the best way to sustain this "balancing act" is to create a schedule.

**What are your academic/professional goals in the near future?**

Ballet careers do not last indefinitely, so I am making sure to secure a strong educational base for life after ballet. Right now, my goal is to complete high school, then go to university to study in a field related to osteopathic therapy or forensics.

**Do you have any advice for students interested in taking courses online?**

My best piece of advice for students looking to transition to online school is to create a schedule! It can be intimidating when you initially log in to your course and see all of the course content, but it becomes much more manageable once you break it down and plan out what you would like to complete when. I would also say to always remind yourself of your goals, stay determined, don't give up, and success will come.

> Thank you for reading through my interview, and I hope my answers help with your transition to Canada e Academy!
