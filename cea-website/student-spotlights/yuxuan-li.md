# Yuxuan Li

**Canada e Academy Student**

---

Yuxuan Li studies the Ontario curriculum from his home in China. He is currently working on two courses through a joint partnership, so we asked him to provide a bit of feedback on his experience thus far.

**First off, what courses are you taking with Canada e Academy and why?**

I am currently taking SCH4U (Grade 12 Chemistry) and SPH4U (Grade 12 Physics) with Canada e Academy. My high school has no physics or chemistry teacher, so I'm taking it online.

**Why did you choose to take your courses through Canada e Academy?**

Canada e Academy courses help me satisfy the needs of my university application requirement. Without Canada e Academy, I would not be able to apply to the programme I wanted.

**What were your favourite parts of online learning?**

I think my favourite parts are the lessons and the short quizzes after each lesson.

**What did you like about Canada e Academy?**

I'm finding it quite convenient to complete everything online. It's a lot safer to do it this way than going abroad and taking the risk of being infected by COVID. I also like that I don't have to be online at a particular time of day and that I can complete these lessons whenever I want. I also liked being able to go back and see the lessons again.

**Do you have anything else you'd like to mention about your experiences with Canada e Academy?**

I hope a 100% online high school can be a permanent solution after the pandemic.

Canada e Academy offered a 100% online high school before the pandemic, and will continue to provide it after the pandemic! In the meantime, we are happy to help students who need an online school solution either due to the pandemic, or for any other reason!

We'd also like to thank Yuxuan for choosing Canada e Academy, and for taking the time to respond to our questions. He is doing very well in his classes with us, and we're sure he will continue to do well in the future!
