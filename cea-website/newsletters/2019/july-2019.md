## Teacher Spotlight: Meet Ms. Bolt

Hi, my name is Cassandra Bolt and I am a math teacher with Canada e Academy! When I am not teaching, I enjoy partaking in the sport of curling. In fact, I spent my entire winter at my local curling club either playing, coaching, organising, or just watching!

Now that the weather is nice, I spend most of my time outside. Throughout the summer, I enjoy camping, hiking, or just being outdoors enjoying the sunshine!
