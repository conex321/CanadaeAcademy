## Principal Spotlight: Meet Mr. Michael

It is my sincere honour to join the Canada e Academy team of experienced teachers and support staff who are so committed to providing a thriving educational environment for our students.

I started in education as a math teacher after graduating from the Faculty of Education. After years of teaching high school mathematics, I became a Department Head, Vice-Principal and Principal.

My passion turned to eLearning when it became clear to me that there are many students whose needs cannot be met in a day school. After a year of planning, I implemented eLearning in York Region and was appointed Principal of its Virtual Schooling programme. The programme has enjoyed many years of significant growth since then.

Beyond education, I have spent many years as a volunteer with the Canadian Diabetes Association at the local, provincial, and national levels. In my spare time, I love to camp, golf, garden, and do woodworking.
