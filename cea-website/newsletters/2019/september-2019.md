## Teacher Spotlight: Meet Ms. Hansen

Hi, my name is Rebecca Hansen and I am a math teacher with Canada e Academy! When I am not teaching, I love to travel. In fact, I spent two years living in China and travelling all over Asia at the start of my teaching career. Of all my travels thus far, Thailand has been my favourite!
