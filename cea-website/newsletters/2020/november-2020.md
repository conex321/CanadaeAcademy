## New Teacher Spotlight: Meet Ms. Pe

Hi, my name is Ms. Pe and I am a new teacher with Canada e Academy! Outside of teaching, I love to travel and explore new places, as well as experience different cuisines from all over the world. I love to cook and bake, and it would be my ultimate dream to travel and stay in different places while learning the region's culinary arts.
