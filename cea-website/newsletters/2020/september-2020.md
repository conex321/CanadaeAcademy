# Canada e Academy Newsletter — September 2020

Head back to class with confidence with Canada e Academy! Interested in going online full-time? We are here to help!

This year's back-to-school excitement has been clouded by uncertainty, and even trepidation, for many. As students across the country were introduced to e-learning last spring, many look to reliable online options to ensure a safe return to school this September.

As a school inspected by the Ontario Ministry of Education with over 10 years of online-only experience, Canada e Academy offers an easy-to-use platform that supports multiple learning styles. Our self-paced, fully online courses alleviate concerns of in-person contact, unreliable or ever-changing schedules, as well as general social anxieties stemming from months of isolation.

## Our Office Is Re-Opening!

As of September 8th, our office has re-opened for in-person consultation and textbook drop-off. Final exams will continue to be written at home.

## Student Spotlight: Ethan Rodensky -- Recipient of a $500 Academic Scholarship!

This summer, Canada e Academy awarded its first academic scholarship to Ethan for his valuable UX insights that will allow us to further improve our student user experience.

"My time working with Canada e Academy has given me real-world experience to put on my resume."
