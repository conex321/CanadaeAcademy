# Canada e Academy Newsletter — December 2020

## Season's Greetings from Canada e Academy!

If one thing can be said about these past 12 months, it is that 2020 has been a year we will not soon forget. At Canada e Academy, we believe in the value of positive reflection and recognising opportunities for personal growth.

## Holiday Office Hours

The Canada e Academy office will be open remotely throughout the holiday season to better support you as you work through your courses over the winter break. We will be closed on Christmas Day and New Year's Day, and will be closing at 4 pm on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve. All other weekdays will be regular hours, with phone, email, and chat support available from 8 am - 8 pm.

## OUAC Reminder

Have you completed your OUAC application yet? If not, better hurry -- January 15th is the deadline to apply! Also, be sure to add "Canada e Academy" as an alternate school in the "Academic Information" section.

## Focusing on Your Mental Health

2020 has brought the importance of mental health awareness into even sharper focus. As we move into 2021, Canada e Academy is committed to ensuring a strong understanding of mental health, not only for our students but for staff and parents as well. We have created a designated Mental Health Spotlight on our website with new content posted on a bi-weekly basis.
