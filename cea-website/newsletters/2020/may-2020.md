# Canada e Academy Newsletter — May 2020

Spring is in the air! We may still be cooped up inside, but that does not mean we cannot throw open the windows and let the breeze revive our spirits! And while we are staying home and staying safe this month, it is important to stay connected with each other and the world outside.

## Let Us Get Social!

Be sure to follow Canada e Academy on all your favourite platforms! We post weekly blogs, deadline info, study tips, discount codes, plus lots of fun giveaways!

## Teacher Spotlight

Hi, my name is Scott Sanders and I am thrilled to be teaching chemistry with Canada e Academy! Outside of the classroom, I can often be found reading, biking, or pining for the Toronto Blue Jays' season to start up again!
