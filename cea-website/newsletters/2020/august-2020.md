## Student Spotlight: Paralympian Abigail Tripp

With the Paralympics postponed until Summer 2021, Paralympic swimmer Abigail Tripp took advantage of her limited ability to travel and train to set her sights on university instead!

"The Canada e Academy e-learning experience was one of the best I have experienced. I naturally love working independently and can motivate myself without outside factors, so the model was ideal for me. As an athlete, online learning is beneficial because I can bring it with me wherever I go without the worry of falling behind."
