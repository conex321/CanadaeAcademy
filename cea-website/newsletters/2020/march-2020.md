# Canada e Academy Newsletter — March 2020

Spring is just around the corner, and that means it is crunch time for high school seniors applying to post-secondary!

## OUAC Midterm Collection

OUAC's second semester midterm collection period opens in a few short weeks, and it is the last chance for 101 Applicants to have their marks updated before finals season! OUAC will collect all remaining midterms for 101s from March 16th to April 23rd.

Tuesday, April 7th will be the registration cutoff for students who need to meet this deadline. Students are encouraged to sign up well in advance of this date to ensure they have maximum time to complete their assignments.

**Reminder:** In order to qualify for a midterm, students must:
- have been enrolled in a course for at least 14 days
- have a valid prerequisite on file (i.e. final report card, transcript, or credit counselling summary)
- have the first 2-3 units worth of assignments in their course completed and marked by their instructor
