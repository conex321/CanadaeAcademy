# Canada e Academy Newsletter — October 2020

The struggle to ensure a safe return to class this September has led to a rocky start for families across the province. As we now face the dreaded (but widely anticipated) second wave of COVID-19, many are growing frustrated with the continuing uncertainty surrounding the 2020-2021 academic year.

It is our sincere hope that the quality course content we offer will allow students to maintain their daily learning routine, while providing the added flexibility that is so essential in fostering good mental health.

Wishing you continued health and academic success,
The Canada e Academy Team
