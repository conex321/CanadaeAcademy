# Canada e Academy Newsletter — April 2020

## Our Response to COVID-19

As an online school proudly serving more than 5,000 students worldwide, we know how critical the ability to learn online is in helping our students maintain their academic focus during complex times such as these. At this time, our primary mission is to continue meeting the needs of our students while ensuring that the health and safety of our staff is cared for.

In response to the ongoing global health situation surrounding COVID-19, Canada e Academy has:

- Ceased all in-office operation as of March 16th. As a result, all in-office exams, partnership meetings, and drop-in consultations have been discontinued until further notice.
- Moved all in-office employees to work from home in a thoughtful, choreographed manner, with minimal interruption to the service and support available.
- Partnered with Examity to work towards introducing safe, online solutions for students needing to complete final exams during this period of social distancing.
- Continued to encourage all teachers to work from the safety and comfort of their own homes as per usual, with additional internal support for those dealing with childcare adjustments.
- Introduced weekly posted office hours for all instructors to allow prompt response to email inquiries between student and teacher.

**Services that remain unchanged:**
- Report cards and OUAC submissions will be processed daily as usual, without interruption.
- Hard copies of midterm and final report cards and transcripts will be mailed to the student's home address daily.
- Our administrative team will continue to provide uninterrupted support via phone, email, and online chat between the hours of 8 am and 8 pm, Monday to Friday.

## Introducing Teacher Office Hours

At Canada e Academy, we constantly strive to provide our students with the best possible learning experience. That is why we are proud to announce that in addition to our regular 24-hour email response time, all teachers will now be holding weekly office hours!
