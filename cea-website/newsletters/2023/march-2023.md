# Canada e Academy Newsletter — March 2023

With spring coming up fast, all of us here at Canada e Academy are looking forward to warmer weather and longer days. Along with sunnier skies, we are heading into crunch time for high school seniors applying to post-secondary programmes.

## OUAC Deadline

OUAC's next collection period for midterm marks and any final grades available begins on March 13th and will end on April 27th, 2023.

## Podcast Volunteers Wanted

As part of our excellent Podcast Series, we are looking for 3 student volunteers to talk about their experiences with communication skills, adaptive thinking in the digital world, and thinking skills for school.

## Upgrading Courses

For senior students looking to apply to post-secondary, it can be upsetting to finish a course with a lower grade than what you need or want for your applications. However, with an online high school like Canada e Academy, there is still time to improve your marks. Our Upgrade Programme allows students to retake a course and complete it in as little as 3 weeks.

## Course Highlight: Grade 12 English

Grade 12 English is a required course to both graduate from high school in Ontario and to apply to post-secondary programmes. Our ENG4U course aims to develop critical and creative thinking skills, as well as essential communication skills needed for both academic and daily life.
