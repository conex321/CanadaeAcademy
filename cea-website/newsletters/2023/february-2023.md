## Black History Month

In honour of Black History Month, we would like to highlight Black authors who have written Young Adult books that we think our students would love.

### The Hate You Give

The Hate You Give is Angie Thomas's debut novel published in 2017. The book centres around 16-year-old Starr Carter who is living in two worlds. This novel was inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement.

## OUAC Deadline

OUAC's next collection period for midterm marks and any final grades available begins on March 13th and will end on April 27th, 2023.

## Math Courses

High school math courses are some of the most versatile and highly requested courses by many post-secondary programmes. Whether you plan on going into Business, Engineering, Health or Life Sciences, Computer Sciences and more, math is going to be a subject that you need to succeed.
