# Canada e Academy Newsletter — April 2022

## Midterm Season Is Upon Us

The OUAC midterm collection period is fast approaching. High school seniors are hard at work getting grades in to apply to post-secondary institutions. At Canada e Academy, our students need to submit their required midterm work by **April 15th** if they want to get their midterm submitted before the official last day of the OUAC collection period.

## Mental Health and A Brighter Future Podcast

At Canada e Academy, we do our best to support all our students during this busy midterm season. If you are struggling to stay on task or create study plans, you can get some help from our Student Success team. You can also check out our podcasts, which have helpful tips and tricks about memory and executive functions.

## Nordic Hockey Academy Partnership

We are excited to introduce one of our newest educational partners, the Nordic Hockey Academy. They chose Canada e Academy for our flexible platform and modern teaching methods, allowing their students to train and travel for tournaments without missing out on school.

## US College Expo Canada

On Saturday April 30th there will be a US College Expo at Roy Thompson Hall in Toronto. This is a one-day event that allows prospective college students to connect in person with US College representatives.
