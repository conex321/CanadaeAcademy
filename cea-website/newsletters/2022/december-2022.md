# Canada e Academy Newsletter — December 2022

As we come to the end of the year, it is important to reflect on the exceptional year we have had. Our students have achieved a lot here at Canada e Academy -- many have graduated and started attending top universities and colleges, both locally and abroad.

## Holiday Hours

The Canada e Academy office will be open throughout the holiday season to support you as you work through your courses over winter break.

## OUAC Applications
