# Canada e Academy Newsletter — July 2022

## Our Grads Are Going Places

It is the end of another school year and many students have graduated and are ready to leave high school behind. However, that does not mean they plan to stop learning. Canada e Academy graduates go to some of the top schools in Canada and this year is no different. The most popular programmes among our grads are engineering, business, life sciences, computer sciences, kinesiology, forensic science, and social sciences. Here are some schools our graduates have been accepted to this year: University of Toronto, McMaster University, Queen's University, Western University, University of Ottawa, University of Waterloo, and York University.

## NHL Draft Picks

At Canada e Academy, we are proud to help many athletes balance their education and their career. With traditional school systems, student athletes often struggle to keep up with both their education and their training. With Canada e Academy, athletes are able to build their education around their training schedule.

We would like to congratulate several recent graduates who were drafted into the NHL, including Nathan Gaucher (1st round, Anaheim Ducks), Maveric Lamoureux (1st round, Arizona Coyotes), Noah Warren (2nd round, Anaheim Ducks), Tristan Luneau (2nd round, Anaheim Ducks), Patrick Guay (4th round, Vegas Golden Knights), David Spacek (4th round, Minnesota Wild), and Alexis Gendron (7th round, Philadelphia Flyers).

## Summer Courses

Students are able to sign up and complete summer courses in as little as 3 weeks, making it easy to reach important deadlines. We also offer a wide range of Upgrade Courses that students can take to improve their marks.
