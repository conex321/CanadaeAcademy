# Canada e Academy Newsletter — October 2022

The new school year is well underway and most students are getting settled into their new routines. Fall is the season of change, so if you find that your new school routine is not working for you, there is still plenty of time to make adjustments. At Canada e Academy, we offer continuous enrolment, which means you can sign up and start a course at any time.

## Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test

The Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test (OSSLT) is a requirement for all students in Ontario to graduate. At Canada e Academy, we offer the OLC4O course, which allows students to meet the literacy requirement while also earning an elective credit towards graduation.

## New Courses

We have added two new courses to our Grade 8 curriculum this year: Grade 8 Geography and Grade 8 History.

## De-Streamed Courses

Since the Ministry of Education made their announcement about de-streamed courses, we at Canada e Academy have been hard at work making sure our courses are adjusted to meet the new education requirements, including de-streamed Grade 9 Math (MTH1W) and de-streamed Grade 9 Science (SNC1W).

## Podcast

In the latest episode of A Brighter Future, Alicia Cuzner and Dwayne Matthews discuss what goals are, how to set goals, and the importance of goal setting for education.
