# Canada e Academy Newsletter — March 2022

## Spring Is Just Around the Corner!

Spring is almost here and with it comes sunny skies and warmer weather. All of us here at Canada e Academy are looking forward to the brighter days and helping our students ensure brighter futures.

## Applying with OUAC/OCAS

Looking towards the future means thinking about your post-secondary education. If you are applying to university this year, our deadline for requesting midterm marks is April 15th.

## Mental Health Awareness

Coming out of the dark winter months it is important to check on your mental health. We have a new podcast that discusses how virtual learning can be beneficial for some students' mental health, covering issues with bullying, microaggressions, racism, and general anxiety.

## New Course Spotlight: Visual Arts

We are happy to announce that we have a new course available: AVI4M -- Grade 12 Visual Arts.

## Staff Spotlight: Dwayne Matthews

We are pleased to be working with Dwayne Matthews, an internationally recognised Future of Education and Innovation Strategist, helping government leaders, businesses, schools, educators, and parents understand new and evolving themes in the future of education.
