# Canada e Academy Newsletter — November 2022

Winter is here, and with it comes the busy midterm season. Many Grade 12 students have started their post-secondary applications and are working to get those midterms completed. Do not worry, you still have plenty of time to get those grades in, so take a deep breath and make sure you find time to relax.

## OUAC Submission

OUAC's first collection period is currently open for first semester midterms and any finals achieved thus far. If you would like a midterm or final mark posted during this collection, please be sure to have all required work submitted to your teachers by November 21.

## Podcast

In this episode of A Brighter Future, Alicia Cuzner and Dwayne Matthews discuss what success is, what a successful student looks like, and how to become a successful student.

## Student Spotlight

Lia McKinnie recently graduated from Canada e Academy. She chose us because she wanted to take control of her education and work at her own pace so she could fast-track high school, all while having a flexible schedule that allowed her time for competitive athletics and a part-time job.
