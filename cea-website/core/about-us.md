# About Canada e Academy

## Our Story

Canada e Academy was founded in 2010 on a simple principle: every student can succeed when given the right tools, the right pace, and the right support.

What started as a small Ontario-based online school with three course offerings and a handful of students has grown into a truly national and international learning platform — and our new name reflects that reach. We have grown from a small, provincially focused school to one that serves students across Canada and in over 100 countries around the world.

Over the past 15 years, more than 25,000 students have earned OSSD credits through our platform and gone on to top universities across Canada and around the world, including the University of Toronto, Waterloo, Western, McGill, McMaster, and Queen's.

## What Makes Us Different

### Interactive, Animated Lessons

While other online schools hand you a textbook in PDF form, we built courses from the ground up with interactive multimedia, voice-guided instruction, and practice checkpoints that ensure understanding before you move forward.

Our courses feature professionally animated, voice-narrated lessons. Each lesson includes embedded video, simulations, formative quizzes, and homework activities designed to keep you engaged and reinforce your learning. This is not just online learning — it is learning brought to life.

### A Team of Certified Professionals

Every instructor at Canada e Academy is certified by the Ontario College of Teachers — because your education deserves qualified, dedicated professionals. Our teachers provide personalised feedback on your assessments, answer your questions within 24 hours, and monitor your progress throughout the course.

### 75+ Courses, Grades 7–12

With 75+ courses and growing, Canada e Academy offers one of the widest course selections of any private online high school in Ontario. Start your journey as early as Grade 7 — earlier than most online schools — and choose from university preparation, college preparation, mixed, and open courses to build the pathway that fits your goals.

### A Variety of Assessment Strategies

We use teacher-driven, varied assessments tailored to student strengths — including assignments, essays, projects, video presentations, and tests. This moves beyond random computer-generated multiple-choice exams and allows you to demonstrate your learning in multiple ways.
