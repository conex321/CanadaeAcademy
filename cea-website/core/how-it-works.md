## Step 3: Start Learning Immediately

Once registered, you receive a welcome email from your Ontario Certified Teacher and immediate 24/7 access to your course through our learning platform.

Work through interactive lessons at your own pace. Each lesson features:

- **Professional animation and voice narration** — not just text on a screen
- **Embedded video and simulations** — bringing concepts to life
- **Practice quizzes and activities** — reinforcing understanding before you move on
- **Downloadable resources** — worksheets, homework tasks, and supplementary materials

There are no set class times. Log in any time of day, from anywhere in the world.

---

## Step 4: Submit Assessments

Complete assignments, quizzes, projects, and other evaluations throughout the course. These make up **70% of your final grade**.

- Submit your work online — type your answers, scan handwritten work, or upload digital files
- Your Ontario Certified Teacher provides detailed, personalised feedback within 24 hours
- A variety of assessment types allow you to demonstrate your learning in multiple ways

At the midpoint of your course, you will receive a progress report card.

---

## Step 5: Write Your Final Evaluation

Complete your proctored final evaluation, which accounts for **30% of your final grade**. Depending on the course, this may be a final exam, a culminating activity, or a combination.

- **Proctoring:** Your final evaluation must be supervised by an approved proctor — any professional adult not related to you who has access to a printer and scanner
- **Flexible scheduling:** You choose the date, time, and location
- **Remote or in-person:** Proctoring can be arranged to suit your circumstances

- **OUAC** — for Ontario university applications
- **OCAS** — for Ontario college applications
- **Your day school** — for students taking courses alongside their regular school

A final report card is sent to you and, upon request, to your day school or post-secondary institution.
