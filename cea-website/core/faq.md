## About Canada e Academy

### Is Canada e Academy a real school? Is it accredited?

Canada e Academy is a private high school inspected by the Ontario Ministry of Education (BSID #665804) with authority to grant OSSD credits. Our credits are identical to those issued by any public or Catholic school in Ontario. You can verify our status on the [Ministry of Education Private School Information Site](https://www.ontario.ca/data/private-school-contact-information).

### How long has Canada e Academy been operating?

We have been helping students succeed online since 2010 — over 15 years and 25,000+ credits issued.

### Who are the teachers?

All instructors at Canada e Academy are certified by the Ontario College of Teachers (OCT). They are experienced educators who provide personalised feedback and support. Your teacher responds to your questions within 24 hours.

### What makes Canada e Academy courses different from other online schools?

Our courses feature professionally animated lessons with voice narration and interactive multimedia — not just uploaded PDFs or textbook scans. Every lesson is designed to engage you and build understanding before you move forward. We also use varied, teacher-driven assessments tailored to student strengths, rather than random computer-generated multiple-choice tests.

## Course Experience

### How does online learning work at Canada e Academy?

Once you register, you have 24/7 access to your course. Use your login credentials to access the learning platform. Progress through interactive, animated lessons at your own pace. Complete formative quizzes and practice activities to prepare for unit evaluations, then submit your work online for your teacher to evaluate and provide feedback. Continue through each unit until you are ready for the proctored final evaluation.

### How long does it take to complete a course?

You have up to 12 months from your registration date. Many students complete courses in 4–8 weeks. During July and August, new registrations may complete in as little as 21 days.

### Can I fast-track a course?

Yes. With focused study of a few hours per day, you can complete a course in as little as 4 weeks (21 days during summer months). Students are eligible to write the final evaluation after completing the minimum required hours of instruction.

### Is there a final exam?

Most courses include a proctored final evaluation worth 30% of your grade. Depending on the course, this may be a final exam, a culminating project, or a combination. The proctored evaluation must be written in the continuous presence of an approved proctor. Details are listed on each course page.

### What is a proctored final exam?

A proctored exam is written under the supervision of an approved proctor — any professional adult who is not related to you and has access to a printer and scanner. You choose the date, time, and location. The proctor receives the exam 2 hours before the scheduled time and returns the completed exam to your teacher. If your proctor charges a fee, that cost is your responsibility.

### How do I know if online learning is right for me?

Online learning works well for a wide range of learning styles. You should be motivated, have familiarity with basic computer applications, and be able to work independently. Remember — an Ontario Certified Teacher is assigned to support you throughout and will respond to questions within 24 hours.

### Will my credits be recognised by universities outside Canada?

Yes. The OSSD is recognised by universities in 90+ countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and beyond.

## For International Students

### Do I need a study permit or visa?

No. International students studying fully online do not require a Canadian study permit or visa. You can study from your home country.

### Can I apply to Canadian universities as a domestic (101) applicant?

Yes. Students who earn their OSSD through Canada e Academy apply to Ontario universities through the OUAC 101 application channel — the same channel used by all Ontario high school students.

### Will I be exempt from IELTS/TOEFL?

Many Canadian universities waive English proficiency test requirements for students who have completed Ontario English credits (e.g., ENG4U). Policies vary by institution, so we recommend confirming with your target university.

### What is the PLAR process?

Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition (PLAR) is the process by which your previous education from another country or province is evaluated and converted to Ontario credit equivalents. Through PLAR, you may be able to transfer up to 75% of your credits toward the OSSD, meaning you could graduate with as few as 7–8 new courses.
