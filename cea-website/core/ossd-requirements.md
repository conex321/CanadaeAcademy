# OSSD Requirements

## What Is the OSSD?

An Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD) lays the foundation for future learning and growth in any pathway: workplace, apprenticeship, college, or university. The OSSD is globally recognised and accepted by universities in 90+ countries.

Canada e Academy is inspected by the Ontario Ministry of Education and holds credit-granting authority (BSID #665804). Students can complete their OSSD credits online from anywhere in the world. The OSSD earned at Canada e Academy is equivalent to an OSSD earned through a publicly funded secondary day school.

## Literacy Graduation Requirement

You must meet the literacy graduation requirement to earn your OSSD.

For most students, this means passing the **Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test (OSSLT)**, administered in-person by EQAO, typically in Grade 10.

If you do not pass the OSSLT after two attempts (with at least one failure), you may take the **Ontario Secondary School Literacy Course (OSSLC)** — course code OLC4O — to satisfy the requirement.

**Important for international students:** Students residing outside Ontario who are taking courses through an inspected private school may enrol directly in the OSSLC without ever attempting the OSSLT. Canada e Academy offers the [OSSLC (OLC4O)](https://canadaeacademy.com/courses/grade-12/olc4o) for this purpose.

**Adult learners:** If you entered the secondary school system starting in the 2023–24 school year or later, this requirement also applies to you.

**Opting out:** Students 18 years of age or older (or 16–17 and withdrawn from parent/guardian control) may opt out of the online learning graduation requirement by completing the exemption form available from their school board.

## Community Involvement Activities

You need at least **40 hours** of community involvement activities (volunteering) to graduate and earn your OSSD. You can start collecting volunteer hours in the summer before you begin Grade 9.

For eligible activities and guidelines, consult your school board's website or speak with a guidance counsellor.
